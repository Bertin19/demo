In situations where a good woman is expected to remain silent, literature can provide an important medium for the expression of deeply-felt and sometimes shocking views. In this anthology the award-winning author Yvonne Vera brings together the stories of many talented writers from different parts of Africa. The act as witnesses to the dramas of private and public life. Their stories challenge contemporary attitudes and behaviour, leaving no room for complacency.<p></p>",

The collection presents an epic history of the region through the eyes of its women, from the age of African kings through colonialism and independence.</p>\n<p>Volume 1 of the series, <i>Women Writing Africa: The Southern Region</i>, is also available; volumes 3 and 4 will be published in 2006.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>A major literary and scholarly work that transforms perceptions of West African women's history and culture.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This second of four volumes representing the literary expression of African women focuses on 12 West African nations, documenting the history of this expression since upward of six centuries before colonialism and 20th-century independence. Editors Sutherland-Addy (language, literature, & drama, Inst. for African Studies, Univ. of Ghana) and Diaw (philosophy, Univ. Cheikh Anta Kiop in Dakar, Senegal) have compiled 132 texts accompanied by head notes by eminent authors (e.g., Buchi Emecheta, Ama Ata Aidoo, and Bernadette Dao Sanou) to explain their cultural and historical contexts. These texts showcase not just the written word-in the form of letters, diaries, historical documents-but the spoken word as well, in lullabies, songs, and other oral traditions. Some of these texts are full of celebration and some of powerful emotions; all evoke powerful imagery. Both the texts and the head notes are fascinating to read, and the reader is truly gripped by the passion and emotion of the writers. This anthology provides an epic tale of African history while highlighting African women's valuable contributions to their culture and bringing their voices to life for readers everywhere.
