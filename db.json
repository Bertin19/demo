Characters reveal dignity and doubt in extraordinary situations, including a grandmother who abandons her frail husband in order to carry her grandchildren to safety in Nadine Gordimer's powerful \"The Ultimate Safari.\" J. M. Coetzee's \"Nietverloren\" examines the changing face of Africa through the demise of a small family farm. Binyavanga Wainaina's \"Discovering Home,\" meanwhile, contrasts a young man's year at home in Kenya after several years of cosmopolitan Cape Town life. Despite a rich diversity of style and subject matter, each story, as described in Ben Okri's introduction, \"reveals what hides in people,\" offering intimate glimpses into an array of African lives.

It is a critical addition to the study of African and Caribbean women’s literatures at a time when women from these regions are actively engaged in articulating the ways in which colonial and postcolonial violence impact women.&nbsp;Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.",

Long live the African storytellers!\" &#151; Africa Today<P>\"It is difficult to imagine a more practical introduction to contemporary African epic than this anthology... no other single volume comprehends the full scope of African epic (as opposed to praise poetry) the way this one does.... The stories are engaging, and the free-verse translations are surprisingly readable.... Recommended for all academic collections.\" &#151; Choice<P>Western culture traces its literary heritage to such well-known epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey and Gilgamesh. But it is only recently that scholars have turned their attention toward capturing the rich oral tradition that is still alive in Africa today. These 25 selections introduce English-speaking readers to the extensive epic traditions in Africa.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>Third installment of major literary and scholarly project exposes East African women's history and culture.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The third volume from the Women Writing Africa Project makes a significant contribution to the study of African literature and offers a textured portrait of women's lives in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. These pieces span the centuries from 1711 to 2003, address topics ranging from religion to HIV and represent prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, lullabies and protest songs. Marriage is a theme that runs throughout: \"A Mother's Advice and Prayer\" from 1858 is a nuptial manual in verse, and \"I Want a Divorce,\" taken from a 1922 court record, gives a valuable glimpse of the power struggles between husband and wife. On a lighter note, a collection of recent song lyrics complains about useless husbands and lovers. Many 20th-century writers address colonialism and independence: Penina Muhando Mlama's \"Creating in the Mother-Tongue\" looks at the linguistic, literary and socioeconomic obstacles to writing in indigenous languages. The editors' lucid introduction usefully contextualizes these wonderful writings, and this volume will be especially welcome in college classrooms. General readers who want to be entertained, educated and chastened about women's struggles and triumphs in east Africa will delight in this literary feast. <I>(July)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Patrick Henry Bass</h4>Cultural critic Kevin Powell's <i>Step into a World</i> is a watershed moment in hip-hop writing, a thought-provoking book with a broad range of voices, from Ben Okri to Junot Didaz. <br>\n— <i>Essence</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This anthology of young, contemporary black writers generally maintains a precarious balance between authentic discovery and promotional marketing, although the writing varies widely in quality and relevance (some selections are quite riveting, others just self-absorbed). Divided into six sections--\"Essays,\" \"Hip-Hop Journalism,\" \"Criticism,\" \"Fiction,\" \"Poetry,\" and \"Dialogue\"--the collection presents a broad range of voices and perspectives, although a majority of them are, not surprisingly, from the United States. While some of the texts, particularly those on hip-hop, seem overly dramatic and hyperbolic, some very fine writing emerges in the \"Essays\" section. Mostly autobiographical, these selections address the very real contemporary problems of black identity in a post-Civil Rights era in which the political battle lines have become much more blurred and the issues of self, nation, class, gender, sexuality, and history are immensely complicated. The items in the \"Dialogue\" section are the most strident and the most inventive and compelling. Even though this book will mainly be used as a classroom textbook, it could be a valuable addition to larger collections and other libraries interested in offering brief introductions to young black writers.--Roger A.

    "synopsis": "<p><p>A white knight meets his half-black half-brother in battle. A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of <B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B>.<p> <p>This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from <I>Arabian Nights</I> and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume.<p> <p><B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B> allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning.<p> <p>Contributors include&#58; Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sollors (English literature & Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, \"It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics.\" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967.

In this fascinating retrospective collection, she shares her personal journey through the social and political landscapes of the 1980s, with its recollected moments of struggle and transformation along the way. Written in a variety of styles and voices, ranging from anecdotal memory to historical moment to folklore tradition, these simply presented poems and stories are by turns funny, touching, chilling, thought-provoking and absorbing. Love Child is a collection for the new millennium generation. It is valuable not just for the deeply-felt personal and political insights it has to offer, but for the accessible ease with which it manages to capture the seminal moments of black South African history in the preserving amber of the author's personal recollection.</p>",

Each of the 120 texts in the volume is accompanied by a scholarly note that provides detailed background information, while an introductory essay sets the broader historical stage. Approximately one third of the texts are oral in origin, and few have previously been available in book form.</p>",
    "excerpt": "",
    "synopsis": "<p><P>An essential text for libraries&#151;the definitive collection of women's literatures from southern Africa.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<p>Female characters who suffer madness and insanity are strikingly prominent in novels by women writers of Africa and the Caribbean. To find out why there are so many \"suffocated hearts and tortured souls\" in this literature, Valerie Orlando, who has long studied Francophone text and culture, here closely reads the work of Aminata Sow Fall, Mariama Bâ, Myrian Warner-Vieyra, and Simone Schwarz-Bart, among others. In these women's novels, Orlando finds, madness is the manifestation of a split identity, and in this study she sets herself the task of interrogating the nature of that identity. Francophone women novelists of Africa and the Caribbean—though they come from countries whose unique experiences of colonialism, revolution, and postcolonial regimes have shaped specific and discrete cultures—express a common search for a meaningful relationship between their experience as women to the history and destiny of their nations. Only when \"woman\"' is understood not as an ahistorical object but as a subject whose lived body is entwined with political, cultural, and economic structures, Orlando argues, will insanity finally give way to clarity of being. Interweaving literary citations with theoretical discussion, Suffocated Hearts and Tortured Souls is just as much a masterful explication of profoundly affecting literary work as it is an essential addition to feminist scholarship and theory.</p>",

In so doing, he opens up relatively uncharted terrain in African literary studies. Comprehensive, nuanced, occasionally lyrical, the book covers an impressive range of hitherto neglected francophone novels that are examined alongside canonical anglophone texts. The author places these texts in their colonial and postcolonial contexts, developing upon, and linking, structuralist theories of colonialism and patriarchy. This study offers a radical new position for those scholars who have long sought alternatives to the liberal humanist bias pervading many studies of African women's writing.<p>Students often struggle with the models employed by feminist and postcolonial theorists such as Judith Butler and Homi Bhabha. The clarity with which Harrow explains the positions of such theorists makes his book an essential companion to, and commentary upon, their publications. Kenneth Harrow's study will be of interest not only to African literature specialists, but also to non-literary scholars concerned with questions about feminism, gender construction, colonialism, psychoanalysis, and postcolonial theory.<p></p>",

It would be a shame to deprive today's children of this newly illustrated collection, endorsed by leading black authors, educators, and political leaders, because of the occasional use of this word. Most beautiful is the story of the Prodigal Son, told with a dramatic simplicity that's just right for readers' theater: the wastrel son's return and celebration, the good son's complaint to his father (\"I work, I work, I work, I never left you. All the time you never kill one small goat for me. How you do me so?\"), and the moving reply (\"He was dead and now he live. He ain't got nothin. And he hungry\").

A book to share across generations.<br>\n—(<i>Booklist</i>)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Children&#039;s Literature</h4>These poems, first published in 1946, are at times profound or humorous, but each reflects the uncomplicated view of an African child recounting the Biblical stories in his own way. As Graham presents the poems, the reader (or better the listener) is aware of the importance of the oral tradition in the West African culture. Graham, a missionary to West Africa in the 1920s, heard the stories and wanted others to share them. In this newly published edition, Ashley Bryan adds detailed black-and-white blockprints to offer visual images to accompany the text. Each story is accompanied by one full-page print. Because of the dialect used by Graham, these stories lend themselves to being read aloud or told. One might question the use of dialect, but Graham's introduction presents the origin of the dialect and offers the proper argument for its use. This new edition would be a worthy addition to a body of African literature. 2000 (orig. 1946), Boyds Mills Press, Ages 5 to 8, $17.95. Reviewer: Jenny B. Petty\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>Gr 4 Up-A newly illustrated edition of a 1946 title. Using the vernacular English of West Africa in the 1920s, Graham eschewed \"Uncle Remus\" phonetic spelling, but preserved the idiomatic and idiosyncratic grammar of Sudanic coastal groups (Mandingo, Golah, Kru). Excerpts may sound awkward (\"Now you mens they dead,\" Naomi tells Ruth), but the ear catches on quickly to the meaning of the phrases sung in poetic rhythms. Biblical order is not followed, so the Prodigal Son appears between two Moses episodes, rather than as a Christian parable; only brief accounts of the Nativity, the lost boy-Jesus, and the loaves and fishes come from the New Testament. All of the stories focus on relationships. There is unexpected humor (Goliath's question to David, \"Do you mommy know you out?), drama (Goliath's protracted fall), and poignancy (David's mourning). Solomon's wisdom; Joshua's leadership; and the stories of Joseph, Esther, Job, Elisha, and Cain and Abel are among those memorably retold. Bryan's blockprints communicate a simplicity and strength in harmony with the text. Highly decorative in their intricate design, they also recognize the central character and dramatic moment in each story: Daniel embracing the lions, Isaac embracing Jacob. This book conveys a distinctive flavor of West African culture, and offers fresh, piquant seasoning for familiar Bible tales.-Patricia Lothrop-Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><p>A white knight meets his half-black half-brother in battle. A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of <B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B>.<p> <p>This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from <I>Arabian Nights</I> and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume.<p> <p><B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B> allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning.<p> <p>Contributors include&#58; Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sollors (English literature & Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, \"It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics.\" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967. As stated in a Rita Dove play: \"A sniff of freedom's all it takes to feel history's sting.\" Recommended for academic libraries and for any reader working around the race rubric.-Scott Hightower, Fordham Univ., New York Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

    "overview": "<br>\nFiction. African American Studies. Translated from the French. AMONG THE BLACKS consists of two works: Ron Padgett's translation of Raymond Roussel's early story \"Parmi les noirs,\" first published in 1935 in his book Comment j'ai ecrit certain de mes livres, together with Padgett's memoir focusing upon his own experience among black people. Roussel's story, about a master mariner named White who encounters an African chief named Booltable, is built upon the kind of whimsical and extravagant word play (its first and last sentences are identical except for one letter in one word--\"pooltable\"/ \"Booltable\") for which Roussel was idolized by the French Surrealists. In contrast, as he writes in his Afterword, Padgett's memoir \"grew out of the nagging need to come to grips with the frustrations of being a white American who had grown up in a racist environment and who, despite his rejections of racism at an early age, had rarely felt unselfconscious in the company of a black person.\" \"What he leaves us with is a work that is like the perfectly preserved temple of a cult which has disappeared without a trace, or a complicated set of tools whose use cannot be discovered. But even though we may never be able to 'use' [Roussel's] work in the way he hoped, we can still admire its inhuman beauty, and be stirred by a language that seems always on the point of revealing its secret, of pointing the way back to the 'republic of dreams' whose insignia blazed on his forehead\"--John Ashbery.",

Who created us? Why are we here?

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Starred Review. \n<p>Eight-time Emmy-winner Stewart (America: The Book) seeks to expand his audience to aliens who might land on earth after the extinction of the human race and be puzzled over the artifacts we've left behind. \"Greetings... on behalf of not only ourselves, but the entire Viacom family,\" he writes in this laugh-out-loud, rollicking social satire. In place of skits there are elaborate, color illustrations accompanied by captions written with his trademark deadpan humor; for instance, a photo of a mother and baby-elephant holds the caption, \"advances in contraception and industrialized food production allowed modern couples to have fewer offspring, while leaving the total weight of families constant.\" Nothing is off-limits here, not even Benjamin Franklin, whose pithy saying \"Nothing is certain but death and taxes\" Stewart expands upon. The book ends with a plea to the aliens to reconstruct the human race from DNA in the hope that, with guidance from the visitors, \"we could overcome the baser aspects of our nature... and give this planet the kind of caretakers it deserves,\" revealing the tears behind Stewart's clown.

All rights reserved.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>E.W.com</h4>Has it really been a full six years since Jon Stewart and the writers of <i>The Daily Show</i> released their last book? Well, the delay's understandable. It's a daunting task to cover the history of a 4.5 billion-year-old planet (including the entirety of human existence) in 244 pages.\n<p>You'll recognize <i>Earth's</i> faux-textbook design and irreverent tone from <i>America (The Book),</i> and some gags recur nearly unchanged — the terrifyingly nude bodies of the Supreme Court justices are replaced here with the terrifyingly nude body of Larry King. But the subject's bigger, and the high concept higher. <i>Earth</i> is written as a Baedeker for the aliens who will eventually discover our planet after our species has expired, likely by our own hand. All the entries, hitting topics like love (''liking another person very very very very very very much'') and work (''that which we didn't want to do, but had to, if we didn't want to eat dirt''), are written in the past tense. It's the ultimate gallows humor: We had it pretty good, and now we're all dead.</p>\n<p><i>Earth</i> is The Devil's Dictionary for a new generation, twisting our lives in the light and bringing mordant humor to the commonplace. Despite the timelessness of most topics, the writers manage to be pretty lively at times, such as when they refer to the Grand Canyon as ''the biggest rift in Arizona not involving Mexicans.''</p>\n<p> <i>Earth</i> isn't meant to be read straight through. It's designed to be perused, so you can discover at your leisure all the fun gags and wordplay crammed into its nooks and crannies. Because there are a lot. Enough, in fact, to make you believe this would actually be a fairly comprehensive guide for extraterrestrial visitors, just so long as they have a sense of humor. A–--(Staskiewicz, Keith)</p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Following the 2004 Publishers Weekly Book of the Year America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction—the Hachette Audio version of which won a Grammy Award—Stewart and the writers of his celebrated Daily Show together narrate this satirical overview of humanity written as though it were being explained to aliens of the future who discover Earth after the demise of all human life. Stewart, the primary narrator, explains religion, history, commerce, government, customs, and society in his trademark delivery. Unfortunately, he often swallows his punch lines, thus defeating the efficacy of many of the jokes. Perhaps his brand of humor is better suited to television. Nonetheless, this is a timely and entertaining title sure to do well among Stewart's many fans, who will doubtless laugh along. Recommended. [The Grand Central hc was a No. 1 New York Times and LJ best seller; see the review of the Grand Central hc, also in this issue, p. 122.—Ed.]—J. Sara Paulk, Wythe-Grayson Regional Lib., Independence, VA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4><p>A goofy guide to our planet, with literate ironist Stewart (<em>America: The Book</em>, 2004) at the helm.</p>\n<p>Continuing in the vein of<em>America</em>, but with a touch more detail in both words and images, Stewart and his<em>Daily Show</em>comrades posit that someday soon the ETs we've been hailing for all these decades will arrive—only to find us gone. And why would we not be here? Well, Stewart relegates the possible answers to an appendix that opens, \"At some point between the time this was written and the time you are reading it, we perished.\" Some of those possibilities include ecological catastrophe, nuclear holocaust, disease, robot rebellion and rapture—the last with a generous 30:1 chance of occurring, and evidenced by an \"overall 'Jesus-y' feeling in the air.\" To gauge by the rest of the book, however, the end may well come by dint of our soufflé-like culture's having finally become too airy and collapsed. So it is that<em>Earth</em>is studded with images of all those pop-culture and media figures that one would gladly leave the planet to escape, from Bernie Madoff to Nicole Kidman and J-Lo (or, if not J-Lo, a convincing simulacrum). Stewart lampoons with a broad brush rather than the scalpel with which he dissects pomposity and prevarication on his Comedy Central show. Some of his targets include creationists and school boards, fast-food restaurants, obesity, the medical bureaucracy, the Venus of Willendorf and, not connected to the aforementioned Venus, the use of the brassiere as an instrument of social control. George Bush doesn't escape, of course; but then, neither does Florence Henderson.</p>\n<p>The legions of readers of<em>America</em> will know exactly what they're in for—and readers of whatever stripe, save those who are fans of McDonald's and Satan, are likely to enjoy this one.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Janet Maslin</h4>Like the \"Daily Show\" this parody delivers wittily framed absurdities in a sweetly deadpan way…like the show, [it's] best when it takes on subjects of real substance…That's why the funniest material is about religion and science.<br>\n—The New York Times\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><P>David Wagoner writes about regular lives with plain grace and transcendent humanity, and the seventy-five poems he has chosen for the 2009 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> grapple with life, celebrate freedom, and teem with imaginative energy. With engaging notes from the poets, Wagoner's superb introductory essay, series editor David Lehman's astute foreword about the current state of poetry and criticism, and cover art from the beloved poet John Ashbery, <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i> is a memorable and delightful addition to a series dedicated to showcasing the work of poets at their best.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>From the moment series editor David Lehman invokes the myth of Jacob wrestling the Angel in his introduction, the gloves are off in this year's installment of this popular annual anthology. Lehman devotes much of his introduction to throwing jabs at longtime sparring partner and professional poetry grump William Logan, whom Lehman calls &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin skinned.&rdquo; Guest editor Wagoner chooses to abstain from the scuffle, but there's no denying the aesthetic character amassed by the poems he's selected&#58; American poets not only want to talk about their country this year, they want to talk violence in (and toward) their country. &ldquo;They came to blow up America,&rdquo; writes John Ashbery, followed hard on his heels by Mark Bibbins, who warns our fifth state, &ldquo;Connecticut! we're sawing you in half.&rdquo; Denise Duhamel envisions &ldquo;How It Will End&rdquo; (&ldquo;We look around, but no one is watching us&rdquo;) and Rob Cook, in his bold and incantatory &ldquo;Song of America,&rdquo; tells us, &ldquo;I'm raising my child to drown and drop dead and to carry buildings on his back.&rdquo; It appears our poets are at last ready to confront the hysteria and violence of the past eight years, and who can say there's a better year than 2009 to begin.

    "synopsis": "<p><P>\"How ironic,\" Joyce Carol Oates writes in her introduction to this marvelous collection, \"that in our age of rapid mass-production and the easy proliferation of consumer products, the richness and diversity of the American literary imagination should be so misrepresented in most anthologies.\" Why, she asks, when writers such as Samuel Clemens, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? \"Isn't the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?\"<br> In <b>The Oxford Book of American Short Stories</b>, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many \"different, unexpected\" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle,\" Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" and Hemingway's \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\" But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's \"Cannibalism in the Cars,\" a story that reveals a darker side to his humor (\"That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy\"). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,\" of which Oates says, \"Only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction.\" From Flannery O'Connor we find \"A Late Encounter With the Enemy,\" and from John Cheever, \"The Death of Justina,\" one of Cheever's own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master.<br> This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In these lean times, it is difficult to imagine many libraries champing at the bit to purchase yet another anthology of American short stories. But institutions seeking to expand the diversity of their holdings in this area may find this collection the perfect choice. ``Familiar names, unfamiliar titles'' is the raison d'etre for this new volume. Along with some old chestnuts such as ``The Tell-Tale Heart'' and ``A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,'' editor Oates presents many fresh selections such as Edith Wharton's ``The Journey'' and John Cheever's ``The Death of Justina.'' She includes lesser-known minority and women writers such as Jean Toomer and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman alongside stories by newcomers Amy Tan, Louise Erdrich, and David Leavitt. Each author is given a brief biographical introduction. Recommended for serious literary collections.-- Rita Ciresi, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park</p>",

The modest two-by-three-foot model came with wall brackets and a three-piece starter box of chalk. Its deluxe cousin was framed in wood, had legs and feet, and came \"loaded\": a pair of erasers, a pointer, a twelve-stick chalk set, and a bonus box of colored chalk. I was a third-grader when I spotted that blackboard. Good-bye to Lincoln Logs and Louisville Sluggers. From the age of eight, I wanted to teach.</p>\n<p>My first students were my older sisters. As preteenagers, Gail and Vita were more interested in imitating the dance steps of the American Bandstand \"regulars\" than in playing school, but a direct order from our mother sent them trudging upstairs to my classroom. I'd prepared for their arrival: work sheets, white shirt and clip-on tie, alarm clock hidden under my bed for the surprise fire drill. If my sisters had to play, then they would playact. Vita cast herself as hip-swiveling Cookie Crane, as smoldering a third-grader as there ever was. Gail was Rippy Van Snoot, the class incorrigible. I was launching into opening exercises when Rippy reached past me, grabbed a blackboard eraser, and bounced it off my forehead. Cookie shrieked with delight and lit an imaginary cigarette. I forget which reprobate flung my flash cards into the air and made the room rain arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Fourteen years later I was a high school English teacher with my first actual students. Paula Plunkett and Seth Jinks were the two I remember most vividly from my rookie year. Paula had pretty eyes and graceful penmanship, but she was encased in a fortress of fat. Sad and isolated, she sat at a special table in back because she didn't fit the desks. She never spoke; no one ever spoke to her. In my first-year-teacher naïveté, I sought to draw Paula into the dynamic, thinking group work and class discussion would save her. My plan failed miserably.</p>\n<p>Seth Jinks was in the twelfth-grade class I'd been assigned because I had no seniority. \"The sweathogs,\" these kids dubbed themselves. I was twenty-one, and so were three or four of my sweathogs. We honeymooned for a couple of weeks. Then one morning I walked up the aisle and tapped Seth Jinks on the shoulder. I needed to wake him up so I could exchange the paperback he hadn't read for the new one he wasn't going to read. \"Seth, get your head off the desk,\" I said. \"Here's the new book.\" No response. I poked him. He looked up at me with little-boy-lost eyes. \"Go fuck yourself,\" he said. The room went quiet. The sweathogs, Seth, and I held our collective breath and waited for my response. And in that uneasy silence, and the days, and months, and decades that followed, teaching became for me not just a job but a calling. I have found special meaning in working with hard nuts, tough cookies, and hurtin' buckaroos - those children among us who are the walking wounded.</p>\n<p>That said, I did not want to go to York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's maximum-security prison for women, on that warm August afternoon in 1999. I was keeping a promise I'd made to Marge Cohen, the prison school librarian. Marge had called three months earlier, as I was preparing for a twelve-city book tour in support of my second novel, I Know This Much Is True. Several suicides and suicide attempts had triggered an epidemic of despair at the prison, Marge had explained; the school staff, groping to find help, was canvasing the community. They thought writing might prove useful to the women as a coping tool. Would I come and speak? Because I'm frequently asked to support good causes and have a hard time saying no, I keep an index card taped to my phone - a scripted refusal that allows me to preserve family and writing time. That day, though, I couldn't find my card. I told Marge I'd visit when I got back from my book tour.</p>\n<p>I would never have predicted an author's life for myself, but when I was thirty, while on summer hiatus from teaching, I'd sat down and written a short story on a whim. I liked doing it and wrote another. For my third story, I fused a sarcastic voice to the visual memory of the mute, isolated Paula Plunkett. For years I had worried and wondered about my former student. What had become of her? What had all that weight meant? Who had she been as a child? In the absence of actual knowledge, the life I invented around her remembered image became my first novel, She's Come Undone. It took me nine years to figure out the story of that bruised fictional soul whom I'd fathered and then grown to love and worry over. I loved and stewed over the flawed identical twins of my second novel, too - one of whom had a generous measure of Seth Jinks's anger. What I did not see coming was that the world would embrace these characters also. \"Hello, Wally? Guess what?\" The caller on the other end of the phone line was Oprah Winfrey. She called twice, once for each novel. The result: best-seller lists, limo rides, movie deals, and foreign translations. Oprah's Book Club had taken my life by the seat of the pants and sent me on the road.</p>\n<p>Rock stars on tour bust up their hotel rooms. They get drunk or high, trash the furniture with their bandmates, party with groupies. But authors on tour are quieter, more solitary souls. Between appointments, we sit by ourselves in our rooms, nibbling like prairie dogs on room service sandwiches, or ironing our clothes for the next reading, or watching Judge Judy. Perhaps the most surreal moment during my book tour that summer occurred in a hotel room in Dayton, Ohio. While channel-surfing, I came upon the quiz show Jeopardy! at the exact moment my name surfaced. \"He wrote the novel She's Come Undone,\" Alex Trebek stated. In the long and torturous pause that followed, the three contestants stood there, lockjawed and mute, itching but unable to press their thumbs to their buzzers. And sitting on the edge of the bed in room 417 of the Westin Hotel, I uttered in a sheepish voice, \"Who is Wally Lamb?\"</p>\n<p>I'm a family man, a fiction writer, a teacher, and a guy who can't say no without the index card. On that nervous first drive to York Correctional Institution, I sought to calm myself with music. I was fumbling with CD cases and radio buttons when suddenly, over the airwaves, a piano pounded and the car shook with the vocal thunder of Newark, New Jersey's Abyssinian Baptist Choir. The unfamiliar song so overpowered me that I pulled to the shoulder to listen. When it ended, I looked up at the highway sign in front of which I'd landed. correctional facility area, it said. do not stop. The inexplicable emotional wallop of that moment fills me with wonder to this day.</p>\n<p>To gain access to the women of York prison, you check in with the guard at the main gate, hang your laminated badge on your shirt pocket, walk through a metal detector, then pass through a series of ten doors, some of which slide open mysteriously after you stand and wait. You don't see who's flipping the switches, so it's an Orwellian entrance. At the prison school, I met my liaison, Dale Griffith, a warm and exuberant English teacher. Dale and I arranged the chairs in a circle, a uniformed corrections officer bellowed orders from the corridor, and thirty inmates entered the room.</p>\n<p>Dressed identically in cranberry T-shirts and pocketless jeans, the women came in all colors, shapes, sizes, and degrees of gender identification. Their attitudes ranged from hangdog to Queen of Sheba. Most had shown up not to write but to check out \"that guy who was on Oprah.\" I spoke. We tried some exercises. I asked if anyone had questions about writing. Several hands shot into the air. \"You met Oprah?\" \"What's Oprah like?\" \"Oprah's cool, you know what I'm sayin'?\" Uh, was that a question?</p>\n<p>At the end of my talk, one of the women stood, thanked me for coming, and pitched me a curveball. \"You coming back?\" she asked. Thirty pairs of wary eyes were upon me and my index card was back in my office. \"Uh, well . . . okay,\" I said. \"Write something and I'll see you in two weeks. Any subject, two pages minimum. Your drafts will be your tickets into the workshop.\"</p>\n<p>At session two, fifteen of the thirty chairs were empty. Stacie wanted praise, not feedback. Manhattan said she'd meant to be vague and nonspecific - that her business wasn't necessarily the reader's business. Ruth must have thought she was a guest on Oprah; she'd written only a paragraph, but man oh man, did she want to talk. At age fifty-five Diane was the senior member of the group. For ninety minutes she hunched forward, fists clenched on her desktop. Her suspicious eyes followed my every move. Diane had written under the pseudonym Natasha and had exacted a promise before class that her work would never, ever be read aloud. I predicted she'd be gone by session three.</p>\n<p>But it was during session three that Diane Bartholomew (\"Snapshots of My Early Life\") couldn't keep her writing to herself. Her shaky hand went up and she asked if she could share what she'd written. In a barely audible voice, she read a disjointed, two-page summary of her horrific life story: incest, savage abuse, spousal homicide, lawyerly indifference, and, in prison, parallel battles against breast cancer and deep, dark depression. When she stopped, there was silence, a communal intake of breath. Then, applause - a single pair of hands at first, joined by another pair, and then by everyone. Bartholomew had sledgehammered the dam of distrust, and the women's writing began to flow.</p>\n<p>That was three years ago. I stopped counting sessions somewhere around number fifty. Writers have come and gone: the narcotics-addicted nurse who wrote a moving apologia to a deceased aunt whose support had never wavered; the high school athlete who, a month after graduation, brandished her softball bat during a convenience store robbery and wrote to figure out why; the young alcoholic mother who time-traveled, penning a personal letter to one of the prison's original 1917 inmates, also an alcoholic. The workshop sessions have been a journey rich with laughter, tears, heart-stopping leaps of faith, and miraculous personal victories. There have been bumps in the road, too. Addicts are elusive; they tend to begin promising drafts, take them to some interesting midway point, then give up on themselves and stop coming. There have been trust issues. Prison is not a place where trust is given easily, and a writer who shares her work in progress risks exposure. That risk taking must be honored. Only the writer should decide when, and if, her work is ready for the eyes and ears of nongroup members - ready, in other words, to go public. If another group member breaches that trust, she has to leave. Similarly, a few con artists and drama queens have been handed their walking papers. A functional writing community cannot accommodate the needs of would-be superstars or instigators of the guess-what-she-said-about-you variety. But those have been the exceptions. The brave writers whose work is represented in this volume have acted in good faith, faced their demons, stayed the course, and revised relentlessly. And in taking on the subject of themselves - making themselves vulnerable to the unseen reader - they have exchanged powerlessness for the power that comes with self-awareness.</p>\n<p>\"I started writing because of a terrible feeling of powerlessness,\" the novelist Anita Brookner has said. The National Book Award winner Alice McDermott noted that the most difficult thing about becoming a writer was convincing herself that she had anything to say that people would want to read. \"There's nothing to writing,\" the columnist Red Smith once commented. \"All you do is sit down at a typewriter and open a vein.\"</p>\n<p>Michelle Jessamy (\"Motherlove\") was fourteen when she became pregnant by her teenage boyfriend. Despite the challenges, Jessamy's impending motherhood helped her get closer to her own emotionally distant mother. As she drafted her memory piece, that mother-daughter epiphany emerged as the centerpiece. Then, mid-draft, Jessamy hit a snag. She began writing a flashback to an earlier instance of sexual abuse - a hallway molestation by a friend of the family when she was eleven. The painful incident was integral to the story she needed to tell, but disclosing her long-kept secret made Jessamy feel uncomfortable. She stopped writing. But self-censorship felt uncomfortable, too. Jessamy had worked hard on her essay and wanted to see it through. The solution? A change of genre. On paper, Jessamy became Mo'Shay Shambly, and the pronoun I became she. Mo'Shay had the same hazel eyes as Michelle, the same experiences. But now Jessamy was writing autobiographical fiction. That little bit of distance unblocked her and she finished her piece.</p>\n<p>Brenda Medina (\"Hell, and How I Got Here\") was self-censoring like Michelle Jessamy, but for a very different reason. For months after she joined our group, she labored on the same short essay about the death of her uncle Carlos - draft after draft after draft. One day I suggested to Medina that, God bless him, I didn't think I had the strength to attend to poor Uncle Carlos's death one more time. \"There's something else I want to write about, but I can't,\" she told me. That \"something\" was what had landed her in prison ten years earlier at age seventeen: her affiliation with a violent street gang.</p>\n<p>York Correctional Institution is vigilant in its efforts to eliminate gang influence within the compound. Incarcerated gang members who choose to uphold their allegiance to \"the family\" pay a steep price in the form of punitive segregation, loss of privileges, and loss of the \"good time\" that can shorten their stay on the inside. A self-described punk when she arrived at York, Brenda Medina had traveled a long and difficult road as an inmate, freeing herself from the psychological grip of her \"family\" and undertaking the rigorous step-by-step process by which an inmate repudiates her gang affiliation and begins rehabilitation in earnest. Even mentioning the name of a gang can cast suspicion that the inmate has reneged on her disaffiliation. Medina's very real fear was that, if she wrote about her past life, her work might be seized, taken out of context, and misconstrued as gang-friendly. If that happened, she could lose much of what she had worked so hard to achieve. My collaborator, Dale Griffith, dealt with the problem directly. She sought and received permission from prison officials for Medina to take up her gang experience as subject matter. With that hurdle cleared, the writer was on her way to a personal essay that, far from glorifying gangs, depicts their insidious hold on young people's lives and the cancerous destruction of their futures.</p>\n<p>In her much-loved book on writing, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, Anne Lamott observes: \"We write to expose the unexposed.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n Excerpted from <b>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</b> by <b>Wally Lamb and the Women of the York Correctional Institution</b> Copyright © 2003 by Wally Lamb<br>\n Excerpted by permission.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>Wally Lamb's novels <i>She's Come Undone</i> and <i>I Know This Much Is True</i> were both Oprah's Book Club selections and No. 1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. On the surface, <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i> is far different than these works of fiction. In this heart-wrenching collection, Lamb introduces and presents 11 female writers who happen to be convicted felons. Their pieces, as potent as their personalities, would be less accessible without Lamb's modest and disarming preludes. \"Prison,\" he writes, \"is not a place where trust is given easily.\" Obviously, he earned that trust, and we now share its fruits.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>The Los Angeles Times</h4>One truth this book affirms is the capacity for people to change. The writers of <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i> chart their own journeys of growth, navigating the terrain of their internal worlds, their pasts and present prison realities. Who they have become is clear both in self-awareness and what they do with their lives — teaching others, advocacy, computer work, construction in prison and out. It is in this change that hope resides; lying next to and rising out of despair, hope permeates the book. Why, in the end, does Lamb want us to care about 10 women in prison? Perhaps because in noticing the humanity of others, we become more human ourselves. — <i>Kathy Boudin</i>\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Bestselling author and Oprah Winfrey favorite Lamb (She's Come Undone; I Know This Much Is True) takes a cue from Winfrey herself in collecting and editing this book of writings gleaned from a workshop he conducted for the female inmates of Connecticut's York Correctional Institution. The result is an intriguing and powerful collection of unlikely literary debuts. Although the 11 selections cover the range one might expect from writings plucked from a women's prison-tales of broken homes, poverty, violence, teenage pregnancy, race and gender bias, and, of course, crime and punishment-Lamb succeeds in giving the collection an intense, recognizable emotional core reminiscent of his blockbuster debut novel, She's Come Undone. Indeed, each selection bears the marks of Lamb's heavy involvement-the clipped yet elegant prose and the delicate, occasionally humorous manner in which difficult emotional situations are rendered. Standout selections include Nancy Whiteley's opening remembrance of her troubled adolescence and Diane Bartholomew's artfully rendered, heart-wrenching \"Snapshots of My Early Life.\" As a sad footnote, Bartholomew, whom Lamb credits with inspiring the success of the workshop, will never see her opus in print. Sent to prison in 1990 for murdering her abusive husband, Bartholomew was stricken with cancer while serving her sentence and died in November 2001. In his introduction, Lamb calls the workshop \"a journey rich with laughter, tears, [and] heart-stopping leaps of faith.\" To the credit of Lamb and his authors, this book, the end product of the workshop, is as well. (On sale Feb. 1) Forecast: Although this book is a departure for Lamb, fans of She's Come Undone will undoubtedly enjoy it. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>At the urgent request of the librarian at York Correctional Institution in Connecticut, Lamb (She's Come Undone) organized a writing class for incarcerated women. The intention was to make writing a coping tool that might counter an epidemic of despair at the prison. The 12 pieces in this volume are the best of the students' efforts, and as efforts they are noteworthy, offering memoirs of childhood and acute observations about prison life. In \"Three Steps Past the Monkeys,\" Nancy Birkla chronicles her dependence on drugs by describing her early dependence on candy. In \"Christmas in Prison,\" Robin Cullen describes a congregation at a prison church service as \"a rainbow of skin tones, their chocolate, honey vanilla, and raspberry ripple-colored hair topped with crocheted red scrunchies that sit like cherries atop ice cream parlor hairdos.\" All in all, the volume represents good student writing and a success from everyone's point of view. If it is vying for shelf space with professional writers, it will probably (and justifiably) lose out. But if funds permit, it is worth considering.-Frances Sandiford, formerly with Green Haven Correctional Facility Lib., Stormville, NY Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Intense attestations of lives that ran afoul of the law, from women who have done or are doing time at a prison in Connecticut. Bestselling novelist Lamb (I Know This Much Is True, 1998, etc.) teaches a course in writing at the York Correctional Institution, and he offers here a selection of ten works from the women in his class, plus one by his co-instructor. The pieces are uniformly wrenching, reported from desperate circumstances by authors doomed to punishment. Yet they are as far from self-pity as possible, written by extremely self-aware authors who give a clear sense of setting out to take some degree of control of their destinies. Each piece is a probing re-examination of its author’s life and of the reasons she ended up in prison. Some recount childhoods taxing by any yardstick, years of learning to become \"experts at detecting the slightest barometric fluctuations of Storm Mom,\" or of being raped by a father who’d just lost the house in a card game—and, at term, having the baby spirited away before its mother was allowed to touch him. There are demons aplenty, inner ones begging to be tamed by drugs, and outer ones, like husbands, uncontrollable (one woman asks, \"Why do I feel safer here in prison than I felt at home?\"). The maximum-security prison is a tough house, and prospects of release for some of the writers are dim: \"Ineligible for parole, I have served the first nine years of my twenty-five year sentence. I am 27.\" This same person will also say, \"I’m kept afloat by my writing.\" And her writing, like other of the women’s, is lean, with the momentum and clarity needed for its work of helping frame and make sense of these authors’ situations. There are things, says Lamb,that need \"to be known about prison and prisoners. There are misconceptions to be abandoned, biases to be dropped.\" Here’s a step in that direction.\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<p class=\"null1\">FOREWORD</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">by David Lehman</p>\n<p>Over the years I’ve read novels centering on lawyers, doctors, diplomats, teachers, financiers, even car salesmen and dentists, but not until 2009 did I come across one about the travails of the editor of a poetry anthology. When word of <i>The Anthologist</i>, Nicholson Baker’s new novel, reached me last September, I couldn’t wait to read it. Baker’s novels defy convention and reveal an obsessive nature, and I wondered what he would make of American poetry, for surely his novel would reflect a strenuous engagement with the art. The title character here, Paul Chowder by unfortunate name, has put together an anthology of poems he is calling <i>Only Rhyme.</i> The phrase describes the notional book’s contents and indicates the editor’s conception of poetic virtue. Paul has chosen the contents of his anthology but is now, on the eve of a deadline, afflicted with writer’s block. He needs to write a foreword but cannot. “How many people read introductions to poetry anthologies, anyway?” he wonders, then volunteers, “I do, but I’m not normal.”</p>\n<p>Having asked myself that same question and given a similar answer, I can appreciate the speaker’s troubling awareness of the many poets who have to be left out of his book—and the relatively few people who will bother to read his introductory essay. The task of writing a prefatory note becomes no less difficult when it is an annual requirement, though Nicholson Baker may have made my job a little easier this time around. Every editor has the impulse to use the introductory space to open the door, welcome the guest, and disappear without further ado. But some things are worth saying, and one such is Baker’s defense of anthologies. For a poet facing all the perils that lurk in a poet’s path—a poet very like the novel’s Paul Chowder—anthologies represent the possibility of a belated second chance. And it is that possibility, however slim, that spurs the poet to stick to a vocation that offers so much resistance and promises so few rewards. The “you” in these sentences refers to the American poet—and perhaps to American poetry itself, an oddity in an age that worships celebrity. “You think: One more poem. You think: There will be some as yet ungathered anthology of American poetry. It will be the anthology that people tote around with them on subways thirty-five, forty years from now.” The poet’s conception of fame exists within modest limits, but it is persistent: “And you think: Maybe the very poem I write today will somehow pry open a space in that future anthology and maybe it will drop into position and root itself there.”</p>\n<p>Baker’s skeptical distance from the fray makes his take on things particularly compelling. The opinions he puts forth are provocative and entertaining. A proponent of the sit-com as the great American art form, Baker’s anthologist believes that “any random episode of <i>Friends</i> is probably better, more uplifting for the human spirit, than ninety-nine percent of the poetry or drama or fiction or history ever published.” That is quite a statement, even allowing for the complexity of irony. (After all, to be “uplifting for the human spirit” may not be the ideal criterion by which to judge poetry or history.) The speaker establishes his credentials as an American poet with his realism for self-pity’s sake. He suspects that poets form a “community” only in the realm of piety: “We all love the busy ferment, and we all know it’s nonsense. Getting together for conferences of international poetry. Hah! A joke. Reading our poems. Our little moment. Physical presence. In the same room with. A community. Forget it. It’s a joke.”</p>\n<p>Baker (or his mouthpiece) likes Swinburne, Poe, Millay, Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, and the contemporary British poets Wendy Cope and James Fenton. He disapproves of free verse, distrusts the “ultra-extreme enjambment” that you find in William Carlos Williams or Charles Olson, and argues that “iambic pentameter” is something of a hoax. As for the unrhymed poems that dominate literary magazines and university workshops, he feels it would be more accurate to call them “plums” and their authors “plummets” or “plummers.” How did we get to this state of affairs? In Baker’s account, the chief villain is Ezra Pound, “a blustering bigot—a humorless jokester—a talentless pasticheur—a confidence man.” Pound advocated modernism in verse with the same bullying arrogance that went into his radio broadcasts on behalf of Mussolini, and that is no accident, because the impulse that led to fascism also gave rise to modern poetry. Modernism as Pound preached it and T. S. Eliot practiced it—in <i>The Waste Land</i>, “a hodge-podge of flummery and borrowed paste”—was, in short, probably as ruinous for the art of verse as fascism was for Europe. The popularity of translations, especially prose versions of exotic foreign verse rendered from a language that the translator doesn’t know, also did its part to hasten the “death of rhyme.”</p>\n<p>The views articulated in <i>The Anthologist</i> are antithetical to contemporary practice in ways that recall Philip Larkin’s conviction that Pound ruined poetry, Picasso ruined painting, and Charlie Parker ruined jazz: the dissenting position, pushed to an amusing extreme, and stated with uncompromising intelligence. The narrator can sound a sour note. To teach creative writing to college students is to be “a professional teller of lies,” he maintains, gleefully quoting Elizabeth Bishop on the subject: “I think one of the worst things I know about modern education is this ‘Creative Writing’ business.” Nevertheless Baker’s opinions are worth pondering, especially when the “difficulty versus accessibility” question becomes the subject of debate. And his advice to the aspiring poet is astute. Don’t postpone writing the poem, he says. “Put it down, work on it, finish it. If you don’t get on it now, somebody else will do something similar, and when you crack open next year’s <i>Best American Poetry</i> and see it under somebody else’s name you’ll hate yourself.”</p>\n<p><i>The Anthologist</i> was well received and prominently reviewed in book supplements that rarely notice poetry books, let alone anthologies of them, except with a certain contempt, which was a mild irony but an old story. Some laudatory articles went so far as to declare that “you” will enjoy the work “even if you generally couldn’t care less about verse.” But then, when poetry or the teaching of poetry is discussed, commentators have a hard time avoiding a note of condescension. Poetry is called a “lost art.” It is thought to be something young people go through, a phase; something you have to apologize for, as when a poet at a reading reassures the audience that only three more poems remain on the docket. And yet poetry retains its prestige. The term exists as a sort of benchmark in fields ranging from politics to athletics. Columnists enjoy reminding newly elected officials that “you campaign in poetry but govern in prose”—an axiom that aligns poetry on the side of idealism and eloquence against the bureaucratic details and inconveniences of prosaic administration. In the <i>Financial Times</i>, the Czech photographer Miroslav Tichý, who spied on women with his homemade viewfinder, “stealing their likenesses as they giggled, gossiped and dreamed,” is described as “a peeping Tom with a poet’s eye.” Of Nancy Pelosi, readers of <i>Time</i> learned that, to the Speaker’s credit, when a colleague’s mother dies, she “encloses a poem written by her own mother with her condolence.” In the same issue of the magazine, a flattering profile of General Stanley McChrystal, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, appeared. During the Iraq war, McChrystal sent copies of “The Second Coming” to his special operators, challenging them to flip the meaning of Yeats’s lines: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.”</p>\n<p>Has there ever been a really good movie about a poet as opposed to the many excellent movies in which poetry is quoted to smart effect? <i>Bright Star</i>, Jane Campion’s film about the ill-starred romance of John Keats and the barely legal Fanny Brawne, came out in 2009 and showed there is life left in the familiar stereotype of the consumptive poet burning a fever for love. Campion won over Quentin Tarantino. “The movie made me think about taking a writing class,” the director of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> said. “One of the best things that can happen from a movie about an author is that you actually want to read their work.” On television, poetry continues to put in regular appearances on <i>The PBS NewsHour</i> with Jim Lehrer and sometimes sneaks into scripted shows. When an advertising copywriter on <i>Mad Men</i> loses his job, he doesn’t take it well. He “did not go gentle into that good night,” an ex-associate observes. The critic Stephen Burt believes that <i>Project Runway</i> holds some useful lessons for poetry critics: “<i>Project Runway</i> even recalls the famous exercises in ‘practical criticism’ performed at the University of Cambridge in the 1920s, in which professor I. A. Richards asked his students to make snap judgments about unfamiliar poems.” I have commented on the inspired way that quotations from poems turn up in classic Hollywood movies, and if you’re lucky enough to catch <i>It’s Always Fair Weather</i> the next time Robert Osborne shows it on TCM, you’ll see a superb 1950s movie musical (music by André Previn, book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green) that sums itself up brilliantly in three lines from <i>As You Like It</i> that enliven a conversation between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse:</p>\n<p>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.</p>\n<p>Then heigh-ho, the holly!</p>\n<p>This life is most jolly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can’t pull the wool over the creative writers responsible for <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent.</i> In a 2009 episode, a celebrated campus bard is murdered by his ex-girlfriend, who is handy with a knife. Has he been pimping out his attractive young assistants to wealthy donors? After learning how rotten the poets are to one another, the major case squad detective says that if her daughter ever says she wants to be a poet, she’d tell her to join the Mafia instead: “Nicer people.” As convalescents confined to hospital beds know, you can go wall to wall with reruns of <i>Law and Order</i>, and sure enough, the day after this episode aired I saw a rerun of <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</i>, in which the villain is a nerdy insurance man, an actuary with Asperger’s syndrome, whose name is Wallace Stevens. The detectives call him Wally affectionately. I spent the rest of my bedridden day with Stevens’s collected poems.</p>\n<p><i>Haaretz</i>, Israel’s oldest Hebrew-language daily, turned over its pages entirely to poets and novelists for one day in June 2009. The results were unsurprising in some ways (a lot of first-person point of view) but inventive and unconventional in the coverage of the stock market (“everything okay”) and the weather (a sonnet likening summer to an unsharpened pencil). The experiment reminded me of W. S. Di Piero’s assertion that the writing of good prose is the acid test of a poet’s intelligence. “Some shy from putting prose out there because it’s a giveaway,” Di Piero has written. “You can’t fake it. It reveals quality of mind, for better or worse, in a culture where poems can be faked. Find a faker and ask him or her to write anything more substantial than a jacket blurb, and the jig is up.” When we posted Di Piero’s remark on the <i>Best American Poetry</i> blog, Sally Ashton added an apt simile (a poem can be faked “like an orgasm”) and a few inevitable questions (“Who is fooled? Who benefits?”). Speaking of the <i>BAP</i> blog, there are days when it resembles nothing so much as a cross-cultural newspaper written by poets and poetry lovers. Recent visitors to the <i>BAP</i> blog could read Catharine Stimpson’s reaction to homicidal violence at the University of Alabama; Lewis Saul’s meticulously annotated commentary on thirty films by Akira Kurosawa; Jennifer Michael Hecht’s heartfelt plea to poets contemplating the suicide of Rachel Wetzsteon (“don’t kill yourself”); Laura Orem’s obituaries for Lucille Clifton, Jean Simmons, and J. D. Salinger; Katha Pollitt on Berlin in the fall; Larry Epstein on Bob Dylan; Ken Tucker on new books of poetry; Todd Swift on young British poets; Phoebe Putnam on the covers poets choose for their books; Mitch Sisskind’s “poetic tips of the day” (e.g., “Secrecy sustains the world”); Gabrielle Calvocoressi at the sports desk; Terence Winch on Irish American music; Stacey Harwood on <i>nocino</i>, the Italian liqueur made from under-ripe green walnuts; and a James Cummins epigram entitled “Anti-Confessional”: “What it was like, I don’t recall, or care to; / believe me, you should be grateful I spare you.”</p>\n<p><i>The Best American Poetry</i> anthology itself, now in its twenty-third year, remains committed to the idea that American poetry is as vital as it is various and that it is possible to capture the spirit of its diversity and a measure of its excellence in an annual survey of our magazines, in print or online. As the selections are made by a different editor each year, each a distinguished practitioner, the series has inevitably become an annotated chronicle of the taste of our leading poets. I persuaded Amy Gerstler to make the selections for the 2010 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> because of my delight in her poems and my respect for her judgment, and it was wonderful to work with her. Amy’s new book, <i>Dearest Creature</i>, came out last year, and augmented her reputation as arguably the most inventive and ambitious poet of her generation. Gerstler can be very funny without forfeiting her right to be taken seriously; she has a quality of sincerity, of truth-telling, that can coexist with the most sophisticated of comic sensibilities. Her poems of deep feeling may take on an insouciant disguise: a letter to a cherished niece about the virtues of an encyclopedia, a conversation between a black taffeta and strapless pink dress, a riff consisting entirely of slang phrases from the not too distant past. Yet always at the heart of the poetry is an insight into the human condition and the ability to state it simply and powerfully: “Some of us grow up doing / credible impressions of model citizens / (though sooner or later hairline / cracks appear in our facades). The rest / get dubbed eccentrics, unnerved and undone / by other people’s company, for which we / nevertheless pine.” David Kirby reviewed <i>Dearest Creature</i> in <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i> “Gerstler is skilled in every kind of comedy, from slapstick to whimsy,” Kirby wrote. “Yet there’s a deep seriousness in every one of these poems, like the plaintive ‘Midlife Lullaby,’ in which the cow who is now the meatloaf in somebody’s sandwich speaks of life’s passing pleasures as hauntingly as one of those skeletons who tend to pop up in medieval allegories to remind young knights of their mortality.” Kirby concluded his review with a ringing endorsement: “In Amy Gerstler I trust.”</p>\n<p>The world has been slow to react to the case of Saw Wai, the imprisoned Burmese poet who was arrested two years ago for publishing a love poem for Valentine’s Day with a secret message critical of Burma’s military dictator, Than Shwe. But the story refuses to die, and the anonymously translated poem itself has now been published (in <i>Pen America</i>) and reprinted (in <i>Harper’s</i>, in February 2010). What early journalistic accounts called a “straightforward” or “innocuous” love poem turns out to be something much richer and stranger. Entitled “February 14,” Saw Wai’s poem, which appeared in the Rangoon magazine <i>The Love Journal</i>, was initially said to have been a torch song to the fashion model who rejected the poet but taught him the meaning of love. Nothing of the sort. It exemplifies rather a particular strain of modernist poetry, the leading-edge poems of the 1930s that were aped (and perfected) by the Australian hoax poet Ern Malley. The poem is an acrostic—that is, the first letters of the lines, when read down vertically, spell out a message, and in this case that message is, “General Than Shwe is power crazy.” In Burmese, Than means “million” and Shwe means “gold,” so when Saw Wai concludes his poem with the injunction “Millions of people / Who know how to love / Please clap your gilded hands / And laugh out loud,” he is secretly urging his compatriots to laugh the “power crazy” head of the junta off the stage. It took courage to write these lines. It also took an extraordinary talent for modern poetry considered as a kind of cipher, and the result in its English translation might be read as either a brief for the methods of modernism or a textbook illustration of what Nicholson Baker would have us see as the tempting dangers of the non-rhyming, prose-saturated “plum”:</p>\n<p>Arensberg said:<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Only once you have experienced deep pain</p>\n<p>And madness</p>\n<p>And like an adolescent</p>\n<p>Thought the blurred photo of a model</p>\n<p>Great art</p>\n<p>Can you call it heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Millions of people</p>\n<p>Who know how to love</p>\n<p>Please clap your gilded hands</p>\n<p>And laugh out loud.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>. Walter Conrad Arensberg, the noted art collector and donor of great paintings to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, wrote <i>The Cryptography of Shakespeare</i> (1922), purporting to find, in the Bard’s plays, anagrams and acrostics that prove Francis Bacon’s authorship. Arensberg wrote symbolist-influenced poetry, but it is conceivable that spurious cryptography is his real contribution to the radical element in modern poetry.</p>\n<p>© 2010 David Lehman</p>",

Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience.<br>\n From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, “into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we’ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.” Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.</p>",
    "excerpt": "Foreword<br>\nThe Essay in the Twentieth Century<br>\nWhen I was very young, my father purchased a small, uniform set of <br>\ncheap literary classics. Why, I never knew. He was not a reader. <br>\nPerhaps he had been duped by a door-to-door salesman. Perhaps he had <br>\naspirations for his children. The books crowded the only bookshelf in <br>\na cramped two-family house hedged in by humming factories on a narrow <br>\nstreet that dead-ended into the mysterious and spectacular sumac-<br>\nlined banks of the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. As a result <br>\nof his once-in-a-lifetime purchase I grew up with the privilege of <br>\nknowing that Emerson was not merely the name of a television set.<br>\n<br>\nI found Emerson's message bracing and liberating. I can see <br>\nit now as self-help elevated to the highest literary standard, but <br>\nreading \"Self-Reliance\" as an adolescent I simply took heart from his <br>\nexhortations to resist conformity, trust in oneself, and not feel <br>\npressured by conventions, parties, and authority: \"I am ashamed to <br>\nthink how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large <br>\nsocieties and dead institutions,\" he said. \"If I know your sect, I <br>\nanticipate your argument,\" he said. \"Insist on yourself; never <br>\nimitate,\" he said. He warned about the physical pain of forced smiles <br>\nand acknowledged the advantages of being misunderstood. If the <br>\nwritings of the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides comprised a <br>\nGuide for the Perplexed, Emerson's essays provided a Guide for the <br>\nIntimidated. His independent, freethinking, inquisitive mind shaped <br>\nAmerican thought and writing, and his spiritual heirsinvented the <br>\ntwentieth-century essay.<br>\nAlthough Emerson may be said to hover over the volume, his <br>\npresence can be detected more directly in one of his most prominent <br>\ndescendants, William James. Although this selection of great American <br>\nessays begins in 1901, one could argue that the symbolic origins of <br>\nthe twentieth-century essay go back to the day in 1842 when Emerson <br>\nwas invited by the James family to visit their New York apartment <br>\nand \"bless\" young William in his cradle. As a teacher, lecturer, <br>\nphysician, scientist, and one of the founders of modern psychology, <br>\nWilliam James would exert a powerful influence over the new century. <br>\nTwo of his students, W.E.B. Du Bois and Gertrude Stein, would <br>\npermanently alter the course of the American essay by initiating two <br>\nnew modes of literary introspection: Du Bois's \"double-consciousness\" <br>\ngrounded in racial identity and Stein's experiments with \"stream of <br>\nconsciousness.\" Both originated in the critical first decade of the <br>\ncentury, and their literary legacies can be felt throughout this <br>\ncollection.<br>\nThe twentieth-century essay also emerged from a resistance to <br>\nthe \"familiar\" or \"polite\" essay that had been a literary staple of <br>\nthe preceding era. Proper, congenial, Anglophilic, the genteel essay <br>\nsurvived, even against the skepticism and irascibility of the Mark <br>\nTwains, Randolph Bournes, and H. L. Menckens, who did their best to <br>\nbury it. By the 1930s, however, some writers were lamenting its <br>\ndemise, and in the most curious metaphors. \"The familiar essay, that <br>\nlavender-scented little old lady of literature, has passed away,\" one <br>\nwrote, regretting that magazines now filled their pages with \"crisp <br>\narticles, blatant exposés, or statistic-laden surveys,\" and <br>\nconcluding that one day \"her pale ghost will not appear at all, and <br>\nthe hard young sociologists can have her pages all to themselves.\" <br>\nBut the \"pale ghost\" did not vanish all at once. It lived on in <br>\ncollege courses and gave the essay a bad name for decades. The goal <br>\nof English teachers, the novelist Kurt Vonnegut recalls, was to get <br>\nyou \"to write like cultivated Englishmen of a century or more ago.\"<br>\nThis collection features none of those \"lavender-scented\" <br>\nessays, not even for historical reasons. Our object was not to <br>\nconstruct a Museum of the American Essay. Although some vestiges <br>\nof \"gentility\" or essayistic \"leisure\" may have seeped in here and <br>\nthere, the ruling idea behind the volume was that the essays should <br>\nspeak to the present, not merely represent the past. So you will find <br>\nmore \"hard young sociologists\" here than \"cultivated\" literati. After <br>\nall, some of those young social scientists were Jane Addams, Zora <br>\nNeale Hurston, and a youthful Saul Bellow, who happened to be <br>\nstudying sociology and anthropology at Northwestern at precisely the <br>\nsame time the genteel essayists were lamenting their own demise. The <br>\nsociologists, accompanied by such self-taught social critics as <br>\nEdmund Wilson, Richard Wright, and James Agee, brought the essay out <br>\nof the library and into the American factories, city streets, <br>\ncourthouses, and tenant farms. For many of them, ardent pacifists and <br>\nreformers, writing essays would amount to what James called \"the <br>\nmoral equivalent of war.\"<br>\nUnlike their predecessors, twentieth-century essayists were <br>\neager to confront inner as well as outer strife. To be sure, the <br>\ngenteel essay was personal, but no matter how \"familiar,\" it always <br>\npolitely stopped short of full disclosure. Here, too, William James <br>\nmade his presence felt. The brilliant chapters \"The Divided Self\" <br>\nand \"The Sick Soul\" in his monumental The Varieties of Religious <br>\nExperience (1902) would become a valuable resource for essayists <br>\nseeking ways to articulate despair, breakdowns, aberrant states of <br>\nconsciousness, psychic confusion, the ineffable in general. F. Scott <br>\nFitzgerald's famous observation in \"The Crack-Up\" - \"The test of a <br>\nfirst-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in <br>\nthe mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function\" -<br>\n laid out a course for future essayists and expanded the <br>\npossibilities of self-disclosure. As writers began amplifying the <br>\npersonal essay into what is now known singularly as \"the memoir,\" the <br>\nprocesses of confession would know no limits.<br>\nWhat next? Will this new century reject our \"best\" essays as <br>\ndramatically as the twentieth discarded those of James Russell Lowell <br>\nand Oliver Wendell Holmes? The 1890s, too, saw astonishing changes in <br>\ntechnology, rapid changes that frightened Henry Adams as he wondered <br>\nwhat the \"Law of Acceleration\" would finally lead to. We have reached <br>\nhis speculative end point - visionary though he was, he never <br>\nimagined a world transformed by electronics. The Internet is already <br>\ngenerating new sources of essays. Will it somehow channel the usual <br>\nprocesses of prose into new literary forms the way some thought the <br>\ntypewriter had once done? Will young essayists discover audiences <br>\nwithout having to sweat through the hundreds of rejection slips James <br>\nThurber received before he could break into print? And will they do <br>\nwhat few from any century have ever done: make a living writing <br>\nessays? These remain to be seen, but what I think we can say for <br>\ncertain is that whatever new forms the essay takes, if they are <br>\nwonderful, they will have the blessing of William James and his <br>\nlegitimate heirs.<br>\n<br>\nAbout This Collection<br>\nThis volume is not a \"best of the best.\" I founded The Best American <br>\nEssays series in 1986, and therefore Joyce Carol Oates and I had only <br>\na small slice of the century to provide us with essays that had <br>\nalready achieved an annual \"best\" status. Only seven of the essays in <br>\nthis volume come from the series. We wish we could have included many <br>\nmore of the superb contemporary writers who have contributed to the <br>\nyearly books, but it was of course not possible. Our consolation is <br>\nthat their work is still accessible to readers and that the annual <br>\nbooks are for the most part available in libraries and bookstores. It <br>\nwas important that we include writers from previous generations who <br>\nmay not be well known to today's readers and who in our opinion still <br>\nvery much deserve an audience.<br>\nI proceeded with this book in much the same way that I have <br>\nwith the annual volumes. I screened a good number of essays - though <br>\nfar, far more than usual - and turned them over to Joyce Carol Oates <br>\nfor a final decision. There were hundreds of essays to consider and <br>\nso little space. But we winnowed and winnowed and arrived at these <br>\nfifty-five. We tried to include the best of as many different kinds <br>\nof essay as possible - personal, critical, philosophical, humorous, <br>\npastoral, autobiographical, scientific, documentary, political. <br>\nObviously we had to pull back in many cases. A comparable volume <br>\ncould be assembled to showcase each one of these categories. I also <br>\nexercised one final choice: I insisted that Oates's essay from The <br>\nBest American Essays 1996, \"They All Just Went Away,\" be included.<br>\n \"Essays end up in books,\" Susan Sontag writes, \"but they <br>\nstart their lives in magazines.\" That fact may not interest many <br>\nreaders, but it played a large role in the research for this book, <br>\nsince between an essay's debut in a periodical and its inclusion in a <br>\ncollection, a good deal of revision often occurs. Vladimir Nabokov's <br>\nmemoir of his father, for example, went through three very distinct <br>\npublishing stages. It began life as \"The Perfect Past\" in The New <br>\nYorker in 1950, but Nabokov, dissatisfied with some of the editing, <br>\nreturned to his original typescript when he included (and expanded) <br>\nit as the opening chapter of his 1951 autobiography, Conclusive <br>\nEvidence. When he revised that book as Speak, Memory: An <br>\nAutobiography Revisited in 1966, he expanded the essay yet again. Of <br>\nthe three published versions, we chose - as we did with many of the <br>\nselections - to reprint the final version, as it would reflect and <br>\nrespect the author's final decisions. But in some instances <br>\n(consistency \"is the hobgoblin of little minds,\" Emerson said), we <br>\nselected the first or a different published version.<br>\nSome essays start out looking like essays only to reemerge in <br>\nunexpected contexts. James Agee's lovely childhood <br>\nreminiscence, \"Knoxville: Summer of 1915,\" started out in Partisan <br>\nReview in 1938 but was given a new twist when an editor cleverly <br>\nborrowed and italicized it in 1957 to serve as the introduction to <br>\nAgee's posthumously published novel, A Death in the Family. Other <br>\nessays in this book were also put to service by their authors to <br>\nintroduce works of fiction: Richard Wright's \"The Ethics of Living <br>\nJim Crow\" became the preface to his collection of stories Uncle Tom's <br>\nChildren, and N. Scott Momaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain\" now <br>\nserves as the prologue to his popular novel of the same title.<br>\nI discovered that there is rarely only one version of an <br>\nessay. Susan Sontag's useful observation sometimes gets reversed: an <br>\nessay starts out in book form and ends up in a magazine. Several <br>\nessays in this volume were skillfully carved out of books and re-<br>\ncreated either by their authors or a magazine's editors as <br>\nindependent essays. Usually, what's required is the removal of the <br>\ninterstitial glue that connects a book's separate chapters. For <br>\nexample, the opening sections of Maya Angelou's 1970 memoir, I Know <br>\nWhy the Caged Bird Sings, were transformed into a memorable childhood <br>\nreminiscence of the same title in Harper's Magazine.<br>\nBecause essays may go through so many publishing variations, <br>\nsettling on a precise date for each selection was no easy matter. I <br>\nproceeded largely case by case. Nabokov's 1966 essay on his father <br>\nwas so transformed from its 1950 origins that it seemed only <br>\nreasonable to use the later date. So, too, I decided to use the final <br>\npublication date for John Muir's Alaskan adventures with his <br>\nunforgettable companion Stickeen; it was that version, and not the <br>\nearlier and now forgotten essay, that became his most popular work. <br>\nBut occasionally I thought it would be misleading to use the final <br>\ndate of publication. Langston Hughes's \"Bop,\" for example, clearly <br>\ncomes out of the forties; though it was revised considerably for <br>\nsubsequent book publication, to place it in a later decade would <br>\ndistort its contemporary flavor. An essay like Mark Twain's \"Corn-<br>\npone Opinions,\" never published in the author's lifetime, is listed <br>\nby date of composition.<br>\nFor the reader's convenience, I have attached brief notes to <br>\neach essay outlining its publishing history and supplying relevant <br>\ncontextual information. I have placed an asterisk before the source <br>\nused for this collection. I have also translated foreign words and <br>\nphrases within brackets when it seemed necessary. Additional <br>\ninformation is contained in the Biographical Notes in the back of the <br>\nbook, where I included pertinent information on the writer's career, <br>\nrelevant details to establish a context for the selected essay, and <br>\ntitles of books and collections (with the emphasis on nonfiction) <br>\nthat will direct interested readers to more books by that writer.<br>\nWriters and magazine editors interested in submitting <br>\npublished essays for the annual volumes should send complimentary <br>\nissues, subscriptions, or appropriate material to Robert Atwan, <br>\nSeries Editor, The Best American Essays, Box 220, Readville, <br>\nMassachusetts 02137-9998. Criteria and guidelines can be found in the <br>\nannual book.<br>\nAcknowledgments<br>\nAs I researched books and periodicals for this unprecedented volume, <br>\nI often felt like Henry Adams, poised at the crossroads of two time <br>\nperiods: the rapidly accelerating age of cyberspace that instantly <br>\nfurnishes vast amounts of information and the old-fashioned era of <br>\ndim library stacks and dusty, out-of-print books. The experience was <br>\nboth high-tech and low-tech. If it was satisfying to sit at my desk <br>\nand click a few keys for immediate access to material that only a few <br>\nyears ago would have required frequent library visits, it was even <br>\nmore satisfying to hold in my hand hardcover first editions of books <br>\nlike Martin Luther King's Why We Can't Wait or H. L. Mencken's <br>\nPrejudices. Even obtaining these books involved travel in both <br>\nworlds: through the Internet I could enter my local library's <br>\nregional network, discover books it didn't own, and conveniently <br>\norder them online. A day or two later - and sometimes within hours - <br>\nI would be experiencing the tactile and intellectual pleasures of <br>\nhandling some of the treasured pieces of our literary heritage. For <br>\ntheir invaluable assistance, then, I want to thank especially the <br>\nstaff of the Milton Public Library as well as all the other <br>\ninstitutions connected with the Old Colony Library Network in <br>\nMassachusetts.<br>\nWhat I was unable to find, my researcher could. Much of the <br>\nknottier research - establishing the original source or date of an <br>\nessay, or tracking down an elusive periodical - was performed by <br>\nDonna Ashley, who relied on the superb resources of the libraries at <br>\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Boston <br>\nCollege, and the Boston Public Library. Nearly all of the source <br>\nnotes attached to each essay derive from her dogged research; without <br>\nher assistance this project might have taken another year to <br>\ncomplete. I want to thank, too, Arthur Johnson for his generous help <br>\nin providing permissions data for all of the essays. I borrowed a <br>\ngood deal of biographical information about the essayists from some <br>\nof my previous anthologies and would like to thank a few coeditors <br>\nfor their contributions: Martha Banta, Bruce Forer, Justin Kaplan, <br>\nDonald McQuade, David Minter, Jon Roberts, Robert Stepto, and William <br>\nVesterman. I'm enormously grateful to Charles H. Christensen for his <br>\nadvice and encouragement over the years. The Houghton Mifflin staff <br>\nhas been helpful and supportive as always, and I'd like to thank <br>\nJanet Silver, Sean Lawler, Larry Cooper, Bridget Marmion, Dean <br>\nJohnson, and Bruce Cantley for all their efforts. My wife, Hélène <br>\nAtwan, kindly read over portions of the manuscript and offered many <br>\nvaluable suggestions for which I am very grateful. Finally, it was a <br>\ngreat pleasure to work once again with Joyce Carol Oates. Her broad <br>\nknowledge of American writing and her literary judgment transformed <br>\nwhat seemed like a paralyzing critical task - reducing several <br>\nhundred great essays to a mere fifty-five - into a spirited, <br>\nilluminating assessment of the modern American essayist's struggle to <br>\nencompass the creative energies and social emergencies of a century <br>\nthat had no shortage of either.<br>\nRobert Atwan <br>\n<br>\nIntroduction<br>\nThe Art of the (American) Essay<br>\nHere is a history of America told in many voices.<br>\nIt's an elliptical tale, or a compendium of tales, of the <br>\nAmerican twentieth century by way of individual essays that, fitting <br>\ntogether into a kind of mobile mosaic, suggest where we've come from, <br>\nand who we are, and where we are going. In his probing, <br>\nprovocative \"The Creation Myth of Cooperstown,\" Stephen Jay Gould <br>\nasks: \"Why do we prefer creation myths to evolutionary stories?\" The <br>\nmore we know of history, of both the natural and the civilized <br>\nworlds, the more we understand that our tangled lives are ever <br>\nevolving, and that our culture, far from being timeless, is a living <br>\nexpression of Time.<br>\nThe essay, in its directness and intimacy, in its first-<br>\nperson authority, is the ideal literary form to convey such a vision. <br>\nBy tradition essays have been categorized as formal or informal; yet <br>\nit can be argued that all essays are an expression of the human voice <br>\naddressing an imagined audience, seeking to shift opinion, to <br>\ninfluence judgment, to appeal to another in his or her common <br>\nhumanity. Even the most artfully composed essay suggests a <br>\nnaturalness of discourse. As our precursor Montaigne advised, \"We <br>\nmust remove the mask.\"<br>\nThe essays in this volume have all been written by writers <br>\nwho have published at least one collection of essays or nonfiction. <br>\nNot only did this principle allow the editors a reasonable means of <br>\nlimiting selections, it is an acknowledgment that writing is a <br>\nvocation, not merely an avocation. In a historical overview of a <br>\ncentury virtually teeming with talent, I wanted to honor those <br>\nwriters who have made writing their life's work. I didn't see my role <br>\nas one to reward the lucky amateur who writes a single good essay, <br>\nthen disappears forever. Better to search for little-known but <br>\nexcellent essays by, for instance, writers of historical significance <br>\nlike John Jay Chapman, Jane Addams, Edmund Wilson. Most of the essays <br>\nare \"informal\"; but this isn't to suggest that they are innocent, <br>\nunmediated utterances lacking the stratagems of art. Even Mark <br>\nTwain's \"Corn-pone Opinions,\" delivered in the author's <br>\ncharacteristic forthright voice, is driven by a passionate <br>\nintellectual conviction regarding the gullibility of mankind and the <br>\ntragic consequences of this gullibility.<br>\nMy general theme in the assemblage of this volume has been a <br>\nsearch for the expression of personal experience within the <br>\nhistorical, the individual talent within the tradition (to paraphrase <br>\nT. S. Eliot). My preference was always to essays that, springing from <br>\nintense personal experience, are nonetheless significantly linked to <br>\nlarger issues, even if, as in the case of James Thurber and S. J. <br>\nPerelman, these issues are viewed playfully. The emotion I felt when <br>\nbeginning to read most of the essays gathered here was one of great <br>\nexcitement and anticipation; even, at times, a distinct visceral <br>\nthrill. As an editor, I am primarily a reader. I could not <br>\ncountenance including essays out of duty's sake that, in fact, I <br>\nfound deadly dull. For the many essays considered for this volume, <br>\nthe majority of which ultimately had to be excluded, I was the ideal <br>\nreader: I wanted to like what I read, and I was committed to reading <br>\nthe entire essay with sympathy. If you will substitute \"literature\" <br>\nfor \"poetry\" in this famous remark in a letter of Emily Dickinson's, <br>\nyou have my basic criterion for the work included in The Best <br>\nAmerican Essays of the Century: \"If I read a book [and] it makes my <br>\nwhole body so cold no fire can ever warm me I know that is poetry. If <br>\nI feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know <br>\nthat is poetry.\"<br>\nAnd what powerful openings in certain of these exemplary <br>\nessays:<br>\nWe are met to commemorate the anniversary of one of the most terrible <br>\ncrimes in history - not for the purpose of condemning it, but to <br>\nrepent of our share in it.<br>\n- John Jay Chapman, \"Coatesville\" (1912)<br>\nThe knowledge of the existence of Devil Baby burst upon the residents <br>\nof Hull House one day when three Italian women, with an excited rush <br>\nthrough the door, demanded that he be shown to them.<br>\n- Jane Addams, \"The Devil Baby at Hull-House\" (1916)<br>\nOf course all life is a process of breaking down, but the blows that <br>\ndo the dramatic side of the work - the big sudden blows that come, or <br>\nseem to come, from outside - the ones you remember and blame things <br>\non and, in moments of weakness, tell your friends about, don't show <br>\ntheir effect all at once. There is another sort of blow that comes <br>\nfrom within - that you don't feel until it's too late to do anything <br>\nabout it, until you realize with finality that in some regard you <br>\nwill never be as good a man again.<br>\n- F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"The Crack-Up\" (1936)<br>\nThe cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our <br>\nexistence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of <br>\ndarkness.<br>\n- Vladimir Nabokov, \"Perfect Past\" (1950)<br>\nOn the twenty-ninth of July, in 1943, my father died. On the same <br>\nday, a few hours later, his last child was born. Over a month before <br>\nthis, while all our energies were concentrated in waiting for these <br>\nevents, there had been, in Detroit, one of the bloodiest race riots <br>\nof the century.<br>\n- James Baldwin, \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955)<br>\nThe decaying, downtown shopping section of Memphis - still another <br>\nMain Street - lay, the weekend before Martin Luther King's funeral, <br>\nunder a siege.<br>\n- Elizabeth Hardwick, \"The Apotheosis of Martin Luther King\" (1968)<br>\nWe were all strapped into the seats of the Chinook, fifty of us, and <br>\nsomething, someone was hitting it from the outside with an enormous <br>\nhammer. How do they do that? I thought, we're a thousand feet in the <br>\nair!<br>\n- Michael Herr, \"Illumination Rounds\" (1977)<br>\nWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.<br>\n- Joan Didion, \"The White Album\" (1978)<br>\nOf course there are crucial distinctions between the art of <br>\nthe essay and the art of prose fiction, yet to the reader the <br>\nimmediate experience in reading is an engagement with that mysterious <br>\npresence we call voice. Reading, we \"hear\" another's speech <br>\nreplicated in our heads as if by magic. Where in life we sometimes <br>\n(allegedly infrequently) fall in love at first sight, in reading we <br>\nmay fall in love with the special, singular qualities of another's <br>\nvoice; we may become mesmerized, haunted; we may be provoked, <br>\nshocked, illuminated; we may be galvanized into action; we may be <br>\nenraged, revulsed, and yet! - drawn irresistibly to experience this <br>\nvoice again, and again. It's a writer's unique employment of language <br>\nto which we, as readers, are drawn, though we assume we admire the <br>\nwriter primarily for what he or she \"has to say.\" For consider: how <br>\nmany intelligent, earnest, right-minded commentators published essays <br>\non such important subjects as racial conflict in twentieth-century <br>\nAmerica, social and personal disintegration in the thirties, <br>\nmorality, democracy, nostalgia-for-a-vanishing-America; class <br>\nstruggle, civil rights, Martin Luther King, Jr., the Vietnam War, the <br>\nmystical experience of nature, ethnic diversity, various <br>\nAmerican \"myths\" - and how few of these are worth rereading, let <br>\nalone enshrining, in this new century. To be an editor in so massive <br>\nan undertaking, committed to reading with sympathy countless essays <br>\nof high worth and distinction published in the most prestigious <br>\njournals of their era, beginning in about 1900 and sweeping through <br>\nthe decades, is to experience first-hand that quickening of dread, <br>\nwhich Nabokov calls mere \"common sense,\" in the realization of human <br>\nmortality. So many meritorious voices, so much evidence of American <br>\ngood will and wisdom, and so many fallen by the wayside! There were <br>\ntimes when I felt as if I were indeed standing at the edge of an <br>\nabyss, entrusted with rescuing pages of impeccable prose being blown <br>\npast me into oblivion, preserving what I could, surrendering all the <br>\nrest. (Those excellent essayists of a bygone time John Muir, Randolph <br>\nBourne, and John Jay Chapman are preserved here; surrendered to the <br>\nexigencies of space limitations are John Burroughs, George Santayana, <br>\nJoseph Wood Krutch, Ellen Glasgow, and others listed in the Appendix.)<br>\nMy belief is that art should not be comforting; for comfort, <br>\nwe have mass entertainment, and one another. Art should provoke, <br>\ndisturb, arouse our emotions, expand our sympathies in directions we <br>\nmay not anticipate and may not even wish. Art should certainly aspire <br>\nto beauty, but there are myriad sorts of beauty: the presentation of <br>\na subject in the most economical way, for instance; a precise choice <br>\nof language, of detail. There is beauty in the calibrated ugliness of <br>\nthe opening of William Gass's meditation on suicide and art, \"The <br>\nDoomed in Their Sinking,\" because it is so finely calibrated; there <br>\nis beauty in the eloquent, elegiac expression of hurt, rage, and <br>\ndespair in James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son,\" because it is <br>\neloquent and elegiac, in the service of art. That staple of <br>\ntraditional essay collections, the unhurried musings of a disembodied <br>\n(Caucasian, male, privileged) consciousness, is missing here, except <br>\nfor its highest, most lyric expression in E. B. White's classic \"Once <br>\nMore to the Lake\" and its total transmogrification in Edward <br>\nHoagland's powerful \"Heaven and Nature\" - which is about neither <br>\nheaven nor nature. (Hoagland, one of the few American writers who has <br>\nforged a brilliant career out of essays, is our Chopin of the genre. <br>\nThough best known for such nature essays as \"The Courage of <br>\nTurtles,\" \"Red Wolves and Black Bears,\" and \"Earth's Eye,\" in the <br>\ntradition of Thoreau, Hoagland is equally memorable as a recorder of <br>\nstartling, confessional utterances of a kind the very private Thoreau <br>\nwould not have dared.) Though there are deeply moving essays in the <br>\nnostalgic/musing mode by such fine writers as White, James Agee, <br>\nEudora Welty, and John Updike, I have given more space to what might <br>\nbe called a radical expansion of this familiar genre, essays that <br>\nhave the power of personal nostalgia yet are not sentimental, and in <br>\nwhich private contemplation touches on crucial public issues, as Zora <br>\nNeale Hurston's \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me,\" Richard <br>\nWright's \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow,\" Baldwin's \"Notes of a <br>\nNative Son,\" Loren Eiseley's \"The Brown Wasps,\" N. Scott <br>\nMomaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain,\" Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the <br>\nCaged Bird Sings,\" Richard Rodriguez's \"Aria: A Memoir of a Bilingual <br>\nChildhood,\" and others. If you begin Edmund Wilson's \"The Old Stone <br>\nHouse\" presuming it to be another nostalgic lament for a vanishing <br>\nAmerica, you will be shocked by the author's conclusion:<br>\nAnd what about me? As I come back in the train, I find that - other <br>\ncauses contributing - my depression of Talcottville deepens. I did <br>\nnot find the river and the forest of my dream - I did not find the <br>\nmagic of the past . . . I would not go back to that old life if I <br>\ncould: the civilization of northern New York - why should I idealize <br>\nit? - was too lonely, too poor, too provincial.<br>\nSimilarly, Donald Hall's \"A Hundred Thousand Straightened Nails\" is <br>\nboth a sympathetic portrait of an older relative of the writer's and <br>\na devastating critique of the romance of American rural eccentricity, <br>\nthe stock material of how many homespun reminiscences in the Norman <br>\nRockwell mode:<br>\n[Washington Woodward] worked hard all his life at being himself, but <br>\nthere were no principles to examine when his life was over . . . The <br>\nlife that he could recall totally was not worth recalling; it was a <br>\nbox of string too short to be saved.<br>\nApart from being first-rate reportage, Joan Didion's \"The White <br>\nAlbum\" can be seen as a radical variant of the genre of nostalgia as <br>\nwell, in which the essayist positions her intimate, interior life <br>\n(\"an attack of vertigo and nausea does not seem to me an <br>\ninappropriate response to the summer of 1968\") within the larger, <br>\nwayward, and \"poorly comprehended\" life of our culture circa 1966-<br>\n1978, with the defiant conclusion \"writing [this] has not yet helped <br>\nme to see what it means\": the antithesis of the traditional essay, <br>\nwhich was organized around a principle, or epiphany, toward which it <br>\nconfidently moved. So too Michael Herr's \"Illumination Rounds,\" from <br>\nDispatches, is appropriately ironically titled, for little is finally <br>\nilluminated in this account of a young American journalist's visit to <br>\nVietnam in the mid-seventies, at the height of that protracted and <br>\ntragic war; the techniques of vividly cinematic fiction writing are <br>\nhere employed in the service of the author's vision, but there is, <br>\nconspicuously, no \"moral\" - no \"moralizing.\" This is the art of the <br>\ncontemporary essay, or memoir: a heightened, trompe l'oeil attention <br>\nto detail that allows the reader to see, hear, witness, as if at <br>\nfirst hand, what the essayist has witnessed. Though this <br>\nis \"informal\" writing, there is no lack of form. Postmodernist <br>\nstrategies of fragmentation and collage have replaced that of <br>\nexposition, summary, and argument.<br>\n<br>\nFor all their diversity, essays tend to fall into three general <br>\ntypes: those that present opinions primarily, and have been written <br>\nto \"instruct\"; those that impart information and knowledge; and those <br>\nthat record personal impressionistic experiences, especially <br>\nmemories. These categories often overlap, of course, as in the <br>\noutstanding essays named above, and in recent years, judging from the <br>\nannual series The Best American Essays, from which essays in this <br>\nvolume published since 1985 have been taken, the genre has evolved <br>\ninto a form closely akin to prose fiction and prose poetry, employing <br>\ndialogue, dramatic scenes, withheld information, suspense.<br>\nThe essay of opinion, of which Montaigne (1533-1592) was an <br>\nearly, highly influential master, was for centuries the <br>\nquintessential essay. Here, you find no dialogue or dramatic scenes, <br>\nonly a rational, reasoning voice. Such an essay is an argument, often <br>\ncouched in conversational terms; its intention is to instruct, to <br>\nilluminate, to influence. Except for editorial and op-ed pages of <br>\nnewspapers, in which they appear in miniature form, and in a very few <br>\ngeneral-interest magazines like Harper's and the Atlantic, such <br>\nessays are not much favored today. In our egalitarian culture we tend <br>\nto feel, rightly or wrongly, that an essayist's opinion is only as <br>\ngood as his or her expertise, and in such uncharted areas as ethics, <br>\nmorals, and general wisdom, whose opinion should be taken more <br>\nseriously than anyone else's? In the past, however, the gentlemanly <br>\nart of opinion-offering was commonplace; Ralph Waldo Emerson is the <br>\nNorth American master of this form. With the publication of \"Nature\" <br>\nin 1836, Emerson's prestige and influence through the whole of the <br>\nnineteenth century was incalculable. Here was a brilliant aphoristic-<br>\nphilosophical mind expressed in an elegantly idiosyncratic language. <br>\nHenry David Thoreau, Emerson's younger contemporary, combines strong <br>\nopinions with a wealth of observed information and firsthand <br>\nexperience in a crystalline, poetic prose, and for this reason seems <br>\nto us more modern, and far more accessible, than Emerson. There is a <br>\nrich subcategory of American essays, the confrontation of nature by a <br>\nrefined, fastidiously observing consciousness, that has descended to <br>\nus from Thoreau; I would have dearly liked to include more <br>\npractitioners of this sort but had room for only John Muir, Rachel <br>\nCarson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, and Gretel Ehrlich. (But all <br>\nthese essays are gems.) In general, our patience tends to wear thin <br>\nwhen we're confronted with sermonizing in its many forms; I most <br>\noften encountered such essays among those published in the first four <br>\nor five decades of the century, when magazines seemed to have <br>\nunlimited space for rambling, genial prose by men with nothing <br>\nespecially urgent on their minds apart from platitudes of nature and <br>\nmorality. Who were the readers of these essays, I wondered. The more <br>\nelusive the subject, the more verbose the style, as in two <br>\nfascinating masterpieces of ellipsis, indirection, and irresolution <br>\nby Henry James at his most baroque, \"Is There a Life after Death?\" <br>\n(1910) and \"Within the Rim\" (1915). (\"Is There a Life after Death?\" <br>\nwas initially included in this volume, and then reluctantly excluded; <br>\nthen included again, and finally excluded. A longtime admirer of <br>\nHenry James, I wanted badly for him to be represented, but the essay <br>\nis, one might say, \"Jamesian,\" and long, and could hardly be <br>\njustified as among the best of the century. And \"Within the Rim,\" on <br>\nthe apparent theme of war, is even more abstruse.)<br>\nYet for all their unfashionableness, the opinion essays <br>\nincluded here are, I think, excellent, and will repay the sort of <br>\nclose, sympathetic reading required for prose that isn't immediately <br>\ngripping and specific. Henry Adams's \"A Law of Acceleration,\" from <br>\nthe classic The Education of Henry Adams, is a bravura work of <br>\nastonishing intellectual abstraction; written nearly one hundred <br>\nyears ago, it strikes a disturbingly contemporary note in its somber <br>\ncontemplation of a mechanistic universe reduced to a series <br>\nof \"relations\" and mankind itself reduced to \"Motion in a universe of <br>\nMotions, with an acceleration . . . of vertiginous violence.\" With <br>\nthe authority of science, Adams says, history has no right to meddle, <br>\nsince science \"now lay in a plane where scarcely one or two hundred <br>\nminds in the world could follow its mathematical processes.\" <br>\nFittingly, William James's famous \"The Moral Equivalent of War\" was <br>\nwritten in the same year, 1910, as Henry James's \"Is There a Life <br>\nafter Death?\" Though William James is a far more lucid prose stylist <br>\nthan his younger brother, both brothers are concerned with profound <br>\nquestions of life and death; William James broods upon the future of <br>\ncivilization itself in a prophetic work that looks ahead to Freud's <br>\nlate, melancholic Civilization and Its Discontents (1930). What is <br>\nhistory but a bloodbath? \"The horrors make the fascination. War is <br>\nthe strong life; it is life in extremis; war-taxes are the only ones <br>\nmen never hesitate to pay, as the budgets of all nations show us.\" <br>\nJohn Jay Chapman, once considered an essayist of nearly Emerson's <br>\nstature, is not much read today, yet his passionate meditation upon a <br>\nnotorious lynching that took place in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, in <br>\n1911 transcends its time and tragic circumstances.<br>\nThe two most influential literary essays of the twentieth <br>\ncentury are perhaps T. S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual <br>\nTalent\" (\"The emotion of art is impersonal\") and Robert Frost's \"The <br>\nFigure a Poem Makes\" (\"No tears in the writer, no tears in the <br>\nreader\"); each gains from being read in conjunction with the other. <br>\nSui generis is Gertrude Stein's \"What Are Master-pieces and Why Are <br>\nThere So Few of Them,\" itself a masterpiece of polemics, an argument <br>\nthat convinces by sheer repetition:<br>\n. . . One has not identity [when] one is in the act of doing <br>\nanything. Identity is recognition, you know who you are because you <br>\nand others remember anything about yourself but essentially you are <br>\nnot that when you are doing anything. I am I because my little dog <br>\nknows me but, creatively speaking the little dog knowing that you are <br>\nyou and your recognizing that he knows, is what destroys creation.<br>\nH. L. Mencken's \"The Hills of Zion\" is, like many of <br>\nMencken's essays and columns, a passionate repudiation of evangelical <br>\nChristianity and anti-intellectualism. This is sermonizing disguised <br>\nas social satire, zestful in its accumulation of damning details; one <br>\ncan see why the young Negro Richard Wright was so impressed by <br>\nMencken's example, seeing the older white man as \"fighting, fighting <br>\nwith words . . . using words as a weapon . . . as one would use a <br>\nclub.\" Katherine Anne Porter's \"The Future Is Now\" is an almost <br>\npurely cerebral opinion piece, less compelling perhaps than Porter's <br>\nelegantly composed short stories, but gracefully argued nonetheless, <br>\nwhile \"Artists in Uniform,\" one of Mary McCarthy's most anthologized <br>\nessays, smoothly combines her satirical gifts with her passion for <br>\nintellectual discourse. Susan Sontag's \"Notes on Camp\" is both <br>\nopinion essay and cultural criticism of a high order; Adrienne Rich's <br>\ndramatically fragmented \"Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying\" might <br>\nbe defined as an essay of opinion in a unique, poetic form. Essays by <br>\nAlice Walker, Richard Rodriguez, N. Scott Momaday, and Cynthia Ozick <br>\nadvance arguments by means of an accumulation of memoirist detail, <br>\nand each presents us with the wonder of how, in Ozick's words, \"a <br>\nwriter is dreamed and transfigured into being.\" And essays that seem <br>\nto be primarily concerned with the imparting of information and <br>\ndescription, like Loren Eiseley's \"The Brown Wasps,\" Tom <br>\nWolfe's \"Putting Daddy On,\" Elizabeth Hardwick's \"The Apotheosis of <br>\nMartin Luther King,\" Lewis Thomas's \"The Lives of a Cell,\" Annie <br>\nDillard's \"Total Eclipse,\" among others, contain arguments of <br>\nsubtlety and insight. Saul Bellow's \"Graven Images\" is a meditation <br>\nin the author's characteristic ironic mode on photography as a <br>\nviolation of personal dignity and privacy and the \"revolutionary <br>\ntransformation\" of a world that no longer honors such values. John <br>\nMcPhee's wonderfully original \"The Search for Marvin Gardens\" makes <br>\nof the popular American board game an allegory of capitalist <br>\nadventure, and rewards us with the unexpected discovery of the <br>\nsecluded middle-class bastion Marvin Gardens, the security-<br>\npatrolled \"suburb within a suburb\" that is one's reward for winning <br>\nthe game.<br>\nThe earliest essay in the anthology, Mark Twain's \"Corn-pone <br>\nOpinions,\" is a superbly modulated argument that begins with an <br>\nengaging portrait of a young black slave (this is the Missouri of <br>\nTwain's childhood, in the 1850s) and proceeds to a ringing <br>\ndenunciation of cultural chauvinism that is as relevant to our time <br>\nas it was to Twain's:<br>\nBroadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly <br>\nspeaking, corn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is <br>\nacquired mainly from the approval of other people. The result is <br>\nconformity.<br>\nBy which Twain means that deathly conformity that leads to an <br>\nacceptance of slavery, lynchings, white bigotry, and injustice in a <br>\nnation constituted as a democracy.<br>\nTwain's essay strikes a chord that resounds through the <br>\nanthology: the ever-shifting, ever-evolving issue of race in America. <br>\nIt can't be an accident that the essays in this volume by men and <br>\nwomen of ethnic minority backgrounds are outstanding; to paraphrase <br>\nMelville, to write a \"mighty\" work of prose you must have a \"mighty\" <br>\ntheme. And what mightier, what more challenging and passionate theme <br>\nfor both writer and reader than how it feels to be of minority status <br>\nin America, from the time of W.E.B. Du Bois in the first decade of <br>\nthe century to our contemporaries Maya Angelou, N. Scott Momaday, <br>\nMaxine Hong Kingston, Alice Walker, Richard Rodriguez, and Gerald <br>\nEarly? For historical reasons obviously having to do with slavery, <br>\nthe experience of blacks in America has been significantly different <br>\nfrom that of other minorities, and this fact is reflected in the <br>\nessays included here.<br>\nW.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" from The Souls of <br>\nBlack Folk (1903), is a chillingly prophetic work that traces the <br>\nintellectual and spiritual evolution of a seemingly ordinary black <br>\nboy from southeastern Georgia who is sent north to be educated in a <br>\nNegro school, returns after seven years to his hometown so thoroughly <br>\nchanged that he seems more foreign to his former relatives and <br>\nneighbors than a Georgian white man would be, and is given advice by <br>\nthe kindly white Judge:<br>\n\". . . You and I both know, John, that in this country the Negro must <br>\nremain subordinate, and can never expect to be the equal of white <br>\nmen. In their place, you people can be honest and respectful; and God <br>\nknows, I'll do what I can to help them. But when they want to reverse <br>\nnature . . . by God! we'll hold them under if we have to lynch every <br>\nNigger in the land.\"<br>\nZora Neale Hurston in \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me\" (1928) defines <br>\nherself very differently from Du Bois's tragic protagonist, partly <br>\nbecause she has been raised in a \"colored town\" in Florida, <br>\nEatonville. Her defiance strikes us as courageous, and touching:<br>\nAt certain times I have no race, I am me . . . Sometimes, I feel <br>\ndiscriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely <br>\nastonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my <br>\ncompany! It's beyond me.<br>\nRichard Wright's \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow: An Autobiographical <br>\nSketch,\" the preface to Wright's 1938 collection of novellas, Uncle <br>\nTom's Children, would become a section of his heralded Black Boy <br>\n(1945). Wright's education in Jim Crow \"wisdom\" begins ironically <br>\nwith a beating his mother gives him for having dared to fight with <br>\nwhite boys, and carries him into a prematurely cynical adolescence; <br>\nit's a vision of the American South contiguous with that of New York <br>\nCity in the 1940s experienced by Langston Hughes.<br>\nPerhaps the preeminent essayist of the American twentieth <br>\ncentury is James Baldwin, and it seems fitting that Baldwin wrote his <br>\nmost powerful and influential nonfiction works, Notes of a Native <br>\nSon, Nobody Knows My Name, and The Fire Next Time, at about <br>\nmidcentury. Baldwin was a natural master of a kind of nonfiction <br>\nnarration we associate with the most engaging fiction, in which <br>\npersonal, familial experience is linked with a larger social and <br>\npolitical context that enhances it as myth. Like his mentor Richard <br>\nWright, James Baldwin was a poet of irony; his bitterness and rage at <br>\nsocial injustice was so finely distilled, his use of language so <br>\nimpassioned and fluent, he made of the most tragically debased <br>\nmaterials a world of startling beauty. Baldwin's is a secular <br>\nmystical vision that seems to us quintessentially American:<br>\nAll of my [newly deceased] father's texts and songs, which I had <br>\ndecided were meaningless, were arranged before me at his death like <br>\nempty bottles, waiting to hold the meaning which life would give them <br>\nfor me. This was his legacy: nothing is ever escaped . . . The dead <br>\nman mattered, the new life mattered; blackness and whiteness did not <br>\nmatter; to believe they did was to acquiesce in one's own <br>\ndestruction. Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to <br>\ndestroy the man who hated and this man was an immutable law.<br>\nThis is the vision of Martin Luther King, Jr., expressed in <br>\nhis historic 1963 \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\": \"One who breaks an <br>\nunjust law must do it openly, lovingly . . . and with a willingness <br>\nto accept the penalty.\"<br>\n<br>\nRobert Atwan, who has been an invaluable series editor for the highly <br>\nregarded The Best American Essays since its inception in 1986, <br>\nassisted me tirelessly and with inspiration in our months-long effort <br>\nof sifting through any and all essays that were possibilities for <br>\nthis anthology. We have been limited, or, one might say, assisted, in <br>\nour selections only since 1986, being obliged to choose essays from <br>\nthe series anthology after that date; before 1986, we had no <br>\nrestrictions. Our decision to reprint essays only by writers who have <br>\npublished nonfiction books helped to limit our search, as did our <br>\nexclusion of journalism, excepting unique reportage like <br>\nHemingway's \"Pamplona in July\" and Michael Herr's \"Illumination <br>\nRounds.\" We hoped to avoid prose fiction in essay form, though such <br>\nprose pieces as W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John\" and Langston <br>\nHughes's \"Bop\" certainly employ fictional techniques; we excluded <br>\nliterary criticism - though some of our finest writers, like Randall <br>\nJarrell, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling, have excelled in it - <br>\nand footnote-laden academic essays for a limited readership, even by <br>\nHannah Arendt. Much as I wanted to include Henry James, as I've noted <br>\nabove, I could not justify reprinting a long, convoluted skein of <br>\nwords that few readers would read. Nor could I include another major <br>\ntwentieth-century writer, Willa Cather, whose available essays were <br>\nsimply inappropriate, and lengthy. Of Norman Mailer's nonfiction <br>\nwork, \"The Fight\" would have been my choice for this volume, but it's <br>\nbook length (and has already appeared in The Best American Sports <br>\nWriting of the Century); other essays of Mailer's, like \"The White <br>\nNegro,\" controversial in their time, are badly dated today. Gay <br>\nTalese, a brilliant practitioner of what has come to be known as New <br>\nJournalism, has written no \"essays\" per se. William Carlos Williams, <br>\nRalph Ellison, John Hersey, Wallace Stegner, Barbara Tuchman, Gore <br>\nVidal, most painfully William Faulkner: these important writers had <br>\nno single appropriate essay. Faulkner in particular seems to have had <br>\nlittle aptitude, or perhaps inspiration, for the essay form.<br>\nOf contemporary essayists there are so many - so very many! - <br>\nwho might well be included here, it isn't possible to list their <br>\nnames except in the Appendix. Quite apart from the numerous memoirs <br>\nof high quality being written today, and published to much acclaim, <br>\nthis is a remarkably fruitful era for the personal essay. The <br>\ntriumph, one might say, of the mysterious pronoun \"I.\"<br>\nIt was the aim of the editors to tell a more or less <br>\nchronological story of America as the century unfolded, with <br>\nrepresentative essays from each decade, as we have done; yet, the <br>\nreader will note, the traumatic experiences of World War II, vividly <br>\ndescribed by William Manchester in \"Okinawa: The Bloodiest Battle of <br>\nAll,\" does not appear in the forties but decades later, in 1987; and <br>\nnumerous other essays, stimulated by memory and meditation, have been <br>\nwritten years after the occasion of their subjects. The ideal essay, <br>\nin any case, is as timeless as any work of art, transcending the <br>\ncircumstances of its inception. It moves, as Robert Frost says of the <br>\nideal poem, from delight to wisdom, and \"rides on its own melting,\" <br>\nlike ice on a hot stove.<br>\nJoyce Carol Oates <br>\n<br>\nCopyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company<br>\nIntroduction copyright © 2000 by The Ontario Review Inc.<br>\nAll rights reserved",
    "synopsis": "<p><p>This singular collection is nothing less than a political, spiritual, and intensely personal record of America&#8217;s tumultuous modern age, as experienced by our foremost critics, commentators, activists, and artists. Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience.<br> From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s &#147;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&#8221; these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, &#147;into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we&#8217;ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.&#8221; Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>\"Here is a history of America told in many voices,\" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy's \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4><b>Bookseller Reviews</b> \n<p>These essays educate us, amuse us, startle us with their immediacy. Who among us can read Henry Adam's \"A Law of Acceleration,\" penned in 1904, and not think of our mind-zapping digital age? Who could resist the first sentence of Zora Neale Hurston's piece:I am colored but I offer nothing in the way of extenuating circumstances except the fact that I am the only Negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother's side was not an Indian chief.\" And which of you could disagree with the unrepeatable wisdom of Gertrude Stein's \"The tradition has always been that you may more or less describe the things that happen nowadays everybody all day long knows what is happening and so what is happening is not really interesting.\"</p>\n<p>The essays that Joyce Carol Oates has selected linger with us, not because their authors (from Mark Twain to Martin Luther King), retain their fame, but because each piece is a talisman, irreducible and well-carved. James Age's prose-poems \"Knoxville, Summer of 1915\" appeals to us today just as it inspired composer Samuel Barber decades ago, and two thirds of a century have only enhanced the thrall of the languorous rhythms of Edmund Wilson's \"The Old Stone House.\" H.L. Mencken's article on the 1925 Scopes trial shames this week's pale convention prose with its freshness, and T.S. Eliot's 1919 \"Tradition and The Individual Talent\" still has something to teach us.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                            </h4>\"Here is a history of America told in many voices,\" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy's \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities. QPB and History Book Club selections; BOMC alternate. Sept. Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From The Critics</h4>\". . . Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces <br>\nreflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of <br>\nvarious American identities.\"\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>KLIATT</h4>In her excellent introduction to this collection, Joyce Carol Oates states her belief that \"art should not be comforting.\" It should, instead, \"provoke, disturb,...and expand our sympathies in directions we may not anticipate and may not even wish.\" The reader should therefore be prepared to have these 55 carefully selected essays do just that. Arranged chronologically, the essays span the century with an average of five essays per decade. From Mark Twain to Saul Bellow by way of William James, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost and Gertrude Stein, the collection notes literary trends as well as social upheavals as recorded in essays of W.E.B DuBois, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright. Chosen from authors who had published at least one book of nonfiction or essays, this collection attempts to present a \"mobile mosaic\" of 20th-century America. Category: Collections. KLIATT Codes: SA—Recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2001, Houghton Mifflin, 624p., Ages 16 to adult. Reviewer: Patricia A. Moore; Brookline, MA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>One of the pleasures of an anthology like this is reading people you might not otherwise have picked up. Like John Muir, whose \"Stickeen,\" a life-and-death adventure on an Alaskan glacier with a singular small black dog, is a great piece of adventure writing. Or Jane Addams, whose insights into the spread of an urban legend of \"The Devil Baby at Hull House\" are thoughtful and compassionate. Another sort of pleasure comes from rereading familiar works in a new context: E.B. White's \"Once More to the Lake,\" N. Scott Momaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain,\" John McPhee's \"The Search for Marvin Gardens,\" and Annie Dillard's \"Total Eclipse.\" Only seven of the essays come from the annual \"Best American Essays\" series that Atwan has coedited since 1986. The other 48 were culled from the rest of the century, with the ruling idea, Atwan says, \"that the essays should speak to the present, not merely represent the past.\" Oates looked \"for the expression of personal experience within the historical.\" They have created a mosaic of a century in an America whose dominant and recurring theme has been race. Essential for most libraries.--Mary Paumier Jones, Westminster P.L., CO Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\\\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Megan Harlan</h4>...all the essays transcend fashion and speak just as eloquestly to us today as they did when they were first published.<br>\n—<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>\n\n</article>"

Elizabeth Hun Schmidt has gathered and introduced poems by each of the forty-three poets who have been named our nation’s poets laureate since the post (originally called Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress) was established in 1937. Poets range from Robert Pinsky, William Carlos Williams, and Elizabeth Bishop to Charles Simic, Billy Collins, and Rita Dove. Schmidt’s spirited introductions place the poets and their poems in historical and literary context and shine light on the interesting and often uneasy relationship between politics and art. This is an inviting, monumental collection for everyone’s library, containing much of the best poetry written in America over the last century.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>The United States has a long tradition of choosing a national poet, though the term poet laureate only came to be used here after 1985. Before that, since its inception in 1935, the post was called consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. So far we've had 43 of them, including some of America's most famous and best-loved poets, such as Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, and, of course, Billy Collins, perhaps the most popular poet to hold the title (2001–2003), and also the author of the foreword to this enjoyable anthology, which offers a sampling of work from all 43 laureates, plus short introductions about each one. Former New York Times Book Review poetry editor Schmidt calls the laureates \"the gatekeepers of the American idiom,\" and above all, that's what a reader will find here: a good sampling of what the mainstream of American poetry has to offer--the careful descriptions of Bishop, the powerful critiques of Brooks, the surreal landscapes of Simic, Merwin's deep images, Bogan's careful stanzas, Lowell's blustery lines. There are a few occasional poems, but mostly, it's a gathering of great poets hanging together because they held an important job. This will be a wonderful holiday gift for poetry lovers. (Oct.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>\"Be careful what you say to us now./ The street-lamp is smashed, the window is jagged,/ There is a man dead in his blood by the base of the fountain./ If you speak/ You cannot be delicate or sad or clever.\" With these lines, Josephine Jacobsen reminds readers that despite all the hardship in the world, poetry is there to report. With this sweeping behemoth of an anthology, Norton and the Library of Congress have given readers and libraries an excellent excuse to own another book. Schmidt, former poetry editor for the New York Times Book Review, has included all of the Poet Laureate Consultants (commonly known as U.S. Poet Laureates) from Joseph Auslander (1937–41) to Kay Ryan (2007–10). Even newly named Poet Laureate W.S. Merwin is included because he served as Special Bicentennial Consultant with Rita Dove and Louise Glück (1999–2000). Schmidt gives readers a fine selection of poems for each poet, some expected and some surprises. In addition, she includes introductions that place poets in social and literary context and elaborates their contributions to the office of Consultant. For example, William Carlos Williams's term was mired in Communist controversy and health problems, and while appointed, he never served. VERDICT A hefty and worthy read that everyone will want to savor. Essential for all contemporary poetry collections.—Karla Huston, Appleton Arts Ctr., WI\n\n</article>"

The novels of such leading figures as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs lend themselves well to excerpting, giving this volume creditable ballast. Representative works of Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gary Snyder are included along with those of lesser-known Beats (e.g., John Clellon Holmes), fellow travelers like Frank O'Hara and Amiri Baraka, and wives and girlfriends often overlooked at the time, including Hettie Jones, Carolyn Cassady and Joyce Johnson. Charters ( Kerouac ) offers a broad perspective on this seminal literary movement: she links East Coast Beats to the San Francisco Renaissance poets; pays attention to such latter-day Beats as Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg; and explains the position of non-Beat but related writers--Alan Watts, Anne Waldman, Diane DiPrima and the young Norman Mailer--in her helpful introductory essay and notes preceeding each entry. Her energizing, liberating anthology makes it clear that such Beat preoccupations as the bomb, the meaninglessness of modern existence and ecological destruction remain current. ( Jan. )</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>Dazzling in its range, exhilarating in its immediacy and grace, this collection gathers together, from every region of the country and from the past forty years, the poems that continue to shape our imaginations. From Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, John Ashbery and Adrienne Rich, to Robert Haas and Louise Gluck, this anthology takes the full measure of our poetry's daring energies and its tender understandings.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Poetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                                        </h4>Poetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Alluding to the anthology wars of a generation ago, McClatchy writes in his introduction that his choices are strictly nonpartisan (neither ``Paleface or Redskin, or Academic and Avant-Garde''). But from the 65 poets he has selected to represent the course of American poetry over the last half century--beginning with Robert Lowell and ending with Jorie Graham--it is clear his preferences are formalistic and academic. The typical poem a reader will encounter in these pages is urbane, finely honed, and smoothly accomplished. As in all anthologies, the omissions and inclusions are telling. Where are Rexroth, Kees, and Rukeyser? Why Cunningham, Bowers, Feldman, and Garrigue and not Ignatow, Brooks, Blackburn, and Bly? While it is a delight to have many of the poets McClatchy has chosen collected together in a reasonably priced edition, a greater variety of voice and aesthetic would have made this anthology a livelier survey of the state of contemporary American poetry. Still, it is a useful addition to most collections. For the 100 most anthologized poems in English, see review of The Concise Columbia Book of Poetry, p. 74.--Ed.-- Christine Sten strom, New York Law Sch. Lib.\n\n</article>"

Organized chronologically with a thematic appendix and streamlined apparatus, this anthology can be taylored to however the course is taught. Individual Fiction, Poetry, and Drama introductions provide an overview for reading and analyzing each genre, defining key terms in context. More than a third of the selections overall represent voices of women, people of color, and writers from cultures outside the United States, and a strong effort has been made to include work that reflects contemporary social questions and will stimulate classroom discussion. New poems, stories, and plays are among the changes to the Fourth Edition.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<b>I'll Fly Away</b><br>\nFurther Testimonies from the Women of York Prison \n<p><b>Chapter One</b></p>\n<p class=\"null1\">Florida Memories</p>\n<p>By Bonnie Jean Foreshaw</p>\n<p>It's Thursday morning at 6:00 <small>A.M.</small>, and we two have just arrived at the open-air flea market, the largest in south Florida. I'm an apprentice shopper and my teacher is my Aunt Mandy. Later this morning, the market will be hot and crowded—alive with music, laughter, gossip, and bartering about the price of everything from necklaces to nectarines. But at the moment, it's cool and quiet. Our focus is fish.</p>\n<p>\"Pay close attention to the <i>eyes</i> of the fish,\" Aunt Mandy instructs as we walk from stall to stall. \"If the eyes are clear, not cloudy, and the color of the skin's not fading, then the fish is fresh.\" Auntie's dressed for shopping in a pink sleeveless blouse, burgundy pedal pushers, Italian sandals, and a white sun visor. I'm wearing shorts, a T-shirt, and rubber flip-flops. I am tall for my age, and starting to get the kind of shape men take a second look at. My glasses take up half my face. \"But you have to shop with your finger and your nose, too, not just your eyes,\" Auntie instructs. \"Poke the fish gently near its fin. If it leaves a dent, then you don't want it. If it doesn't, it's probably part of the morning's catch. And listen to me, Jeannie. Fresh fish never smells foul.\"</p>\n<p>We stop at one of the stalls where the fish are lined up, one against the other, on a bed of ice. The fish man approaches us. He's handsome—black hair, hazel eyes, tank top and cut-off jeans. \"May I help you, ma'am?\" I watch him take in Aunt Mandy's curves, her green eyes andhoney-colored complexion. I might as well be invisible.</p>\n<p>\"Well, maybe you can,\" Auntie says. \"Oh, by the way, I'm Mandy and this is my niece, Jeannie. Now what's your name?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm Ricardo,\" the fish man says. He's sucking in his stomach, and his feet are moving up and down like he's trying to stretch his height. \"It's nice to meet you, Mandy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nice to meet you, too. Now tell me, Ricardo, how much you want for these five yellowtails?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, let's see. They're seventy-five cents apiece, so that's a total of . . .\"</p>\n<p>He stops to watch Auntie pass her fingers through her shoulder-length hair. It's salt-and-pepper-colored, but Mandy's still got it. \"Uh, three seventy-five.\" \"Oh,\" Auntie says, half-shocked and half-disappointed. \"That fellow three stalls down says he's selling his yellowtails for <i>fifty</i> cents each. So unless we can work out a deal . . .\"</p>\n<p>The smile drops off of Mr. Ricardo's face, but Auntie's smile returns. Her gold tooth is glimmering. She shifts her weight, puts her hand on her hip.</p>\n<p>\"Mandy, it's a deal,\" Ricardo says. \"Five yellowtails for two-fifty. That's a dollar twenty-five cut I'm giving you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which I appreciate,\" Auntie says. \"And look at it this way: you've just gained yourself a faithful customer. Now, tell me. How much you selling those red snappers for? If I can get them for the same price as the yellowtails, I'll buy some of them, too. And conch.\"</p>\n<p>I stand there looking from one to the other. Auntie touches the small gold cross at her throat. She fingers her earring. I can tell Mr. Ricardo is only pretending to do the math in his head. \"Okay,\" he finally says. \"Sold.\"</p>\n<p>Auntie pays for the fish and conch, thanks him, and we walk away. A few stalls down from Mr. Ricardo's, she turns to me. \"Okay, now,\" she says. \"Show me a fresh fish.\"</p>\n<p>I go up and down the row, looking each fish in the eye, then pick one up by its tail. I turn it, look at its other eye, study its coloration. When I press my finger against its head, near the fin, there's no indentation. \"This one.\"</p>\n<p>Her look is serious. \"You think this fish is fresh?\"</p>\n<p>I hesitate. \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Aunt Mandy flashes me her gold-toothed smile. \"Well, Jeannie, now you know how to pick fresh fish.\"</p>\n<p>I'm excited to have passed the test, but I've been wondering something. \"Auntie?\" I say. \"I don't remember going to any other fish stalls before we went to Mr. Ricardo's.\"</p>\n<p>She laughs. \"You and I knew that, but Ricardo didn't. It's one of the tricks of the trade when you shop at the flea market. But bear in mind, Ricardo would rather make a sale than not sell. If he has fish left at the end of the day, that's a loss and a waste for him. So we were doing him a favor. Now, come on. Let's cross the street and I'll teach you how to pick out vegetables and fruit.\"</p>\n<p>We meander among the tomatoes and squashes, the potatoes and mangoes and plums. Shopping for fresh produce is a matter of looking and smelling, but mostly of <i>feeling</i>, Auntie says. \"Fruits and vegetables can get damaged by cold weather, the way they're packed, or how far they've traveled to get to the market. If the skin is firm, that means it's fresh. If it's loose, then it isn't. And always check for bruises.\"</p>\n<p>Although I'm listening to my aunt, it's the peaches in the stall to my right that have my attention. They're big and beautiful, golden yellow with blushes of pink, and their aroma makes my mouth juice up. I'm thinking about how I might get myself one of those peaches.</p>\n<p>\"Pick us out some bananas,\" Auntie says. It's test number two.</p>\n<p>My eyes pass over several bunches before I pick one up. I check each banana, one by one, then walk over to Auntie, who is examining pears. \"These are nice, firm, and yellow,\" I say, handing her the bunch I've chosen. \"Tight skin, no bruises.\"</p>\n<p>She twists the bunch back and forth, then nods her approval. \"Good job,\" she says. Smiling all over myself, I decide to seize the moment. \"Auntie, may I get a few peaches?\"</p>\n<i><b>I'll Fly Away</b><br>\nFurther Testimonies from the Women of York Prison</i>.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>In 1998, Wally Lamb began teaching writing to female convicts at Connecticut's York Correctional Institute. It was not for lack of a résumé; he was already an acclaimed novelist (<i>I Know This Much Is True; She's Come Undone</i>) and had been teaching high school for a quarter century. York was something different. After adjusting to his new constituency, Lamb realized that his students had disarming, often frightening stories to tell. In 2003, he published an anthology of these testimonies, the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award-winning <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>. This follow-up collection is just as bracing and profound.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booklist</h4>\"Lamb . . . continues to offer readers an intimate look at women struggling to maintain their humanity.\"\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4><p>Novelist Lamb's (<i>I Know This Much Is True</i>) second collection of writing by the students in his writing workshop at the maximum-security York Correctional Institution in Connecticut, after <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>(2003), also focuses on the inspiring and raw emotions of women sharing the good and bad memories that shaped them. The 20 women whose work is featured here-18 inmates and two of Lamb's cofacilitators-show that writing is not just a way of capturing their most private thoughts and gripping emotions (e.g., hope, despair, courage), but also a powerful tool to foster hope and healing. They write from the heart in works ranging from poems to essays to short stories; each vignette is more compelling than the one before it. Highly recommended for academic and public libraries.<br>\n—Susan McClellan</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>The second accomplished collection of writings from women incarcerated in Connecticut's York Correctional Institution, edited again by bestselling novelist Lamb (Couldn't Keep It to Myself: Testimonies from Our Imprisoned Sisters, 2003, etc.). One would have thought the first volume, with its probing examinations of lives run amok, would have convinced prison authorities of the value of a writing program in which prisoners focus and take account. But the prison bureaucracy tried to shut it down, writes an incredulous and furious Lamb, and they confiscated the prisoners' material. That particular draconian administration was replaced with a more enlightened group, Lamb reports, one that allowed for the rehabilitative value of writing. These works radiate what Lamb saw as the program's critical mission: to give the women wings \"to hover above the confounding maze of their lives, and from that perspective . . . to see the patterns and dead ends of their past, and a way out.\" Some of the stories are rueful, others bitter, but all bite, even-perhaps especially-when they are gentle. None are self-pitying, but none shy away from speaking directly to the gross cruelties so often inflicted on their early years or young marriages. Each story, no matter how grim or gritty, shows polish, and the women display a wide array of emotions: unbridled anger, innocence, hope, resigned acceptance. While a few of the stories speak of angels who touched the women's lives, most display open wounds that are continuing to be healed by the cathartic power of words. Writing as an act of self-realization and liberation and, not incidentally, an indictment of the penal system.\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<b>AMERICAN EARTH</b> <b>Environmental Writing Since Thoreau</b> <br>\n <b>By Bill McKibben</b> <br>\n <b>THE LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> <b>Copyright © 2008</b> <b>Literary Classics of the United States, New York, NY.<br>\n All right reserved.</b><br>\n <b>ISBN: 978-1-59853-020-9</b> <br>\n <br>\n<br>\n <br>\n <b>Chapter One</b> <b>HENRY DAVID THOREAU</b> \n<p>Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was born, grew up, lived out his life, and died in Concord, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard from 1833 to 1837, then signed on as a teacher at Concord Academy but was dismissed for refusing to whip students. He and his brother John opened an elementary school in 1838, where, according to some authorities, they invented the idea of the field trip. John became sick in 1841 and the brothers closed the school; Henry went to live with Ralph Waldo Emerson, beginning a long friendship with him and with the other members of the Transcendental Club, among them Bronson Alcott and Margaret Fuller. The other transcendentalists experimented with communes like Brook Farm, but Thoreau was more solitary, and the most important years in his life began in 1845 when he took up residence in a small cabin he'd built on the shore of Walden Pond a short walk from town. He spent two years, two months, and two days there, experimenting with simplifying his life. Thorean's isolation at Walden wasn't absolute or deliberately ascetic-he often returned to town to see friends and eat meals, had a steady stream of visitors (often too steady for his taste), and at one point engaged in a political protest, spending a night in Concord jail for his refusal to pay his poll tax. But it was notably productive: he returned to town with the draft of one book (<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>) and the notes that he would spend the next six years turning into <i>Walden</i> (1854), perhaps the most remarkable book in the American canon. As dense as scripture, crowded with aphorism, <i>Walden</i> is full of enough ideas for a score of ordinary books. But it has lived as long and as fully as any other writing of its vintage and inspired all the best kinds of people: both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. claimed him as a major influence. Thoreau suffered from tuberculosis contracted during his college years: his condition worsened beginning in 1859, and he spent his last years revising his accounts of the Maine woods and other works. As he neared death his aunt Louisa asked him if he had made his peace with God. \"I did not know we had ever quarreled,\" he said. He died at the age of 44.</p>\n<p>Picking a few fragments from his writings is an impossible task: an anthology of American environmental writing might well be one-third Thoreau. Here are a few entries from his copious journals, and then the description from <i>Walden</i> of the building of the famous cabin. \"Huckleberries,\" a late essay or lecture-text, shows the modern nature essay being born, with a small root giving way to a luxuriant growth of thought and speculation.</p>\n<p><b><i>from Journals</i></b></p>\n<p>Oct. 24th 1837.</p>\n<p>The Mould our Deeds Leave.</p>\n<p>Every part of nature teaches that the passing away of one life is the making room for another. The oak dies down to the ground, leaving within its rind a rich virgin mould, which will impart a vigorous life to an infant forest - - The pine leaves a sandy and sterile soil-the harder woods a strong and fruitful mould. - -</p>\n<p>So this constant abrasion and decay makes the soil of my future growth. As I live now so shall I reap. If I grow pines and birches, my virgin mould will not sustain the oak, but pines and birches, or, perchance, weeds and brambles, will constitute my second growth. - -</p>\n<p>March 6th 1838</p>\n<p>- - How can a man sit down and quietly pare his nails, while the earth goes gyrating ahead amid such a din of sphere music, whirling him along about her axis some twenty four thousand miles between sun and sun? but mainly in a circle some two millions of miles actual progress. And then such a hurly-burly on the surface-wind always blowing-now a zephyr, now a hurricane-tides never idle, ever fluctuating, no rest for Niagara, but perpetual ran-tan on those limestone rocks-and then that summer simmering which our ears are used to-which would otherwise be christened confusion worse confounded, but is now ironically called \"silence audible\"-and above all the incessant tinkering named hum of industry-the hurrying to and fro and confused jabbering of men-Can man do less than get up and shake himself?</p>\n<p>April 24th 1838.</p>\n<p>Steam ships</p>\n<p>-Men have been contriving new means and modes of motion-Steam ships have been westering during these late days and nights on the Atlantic waves-the fuglers of a new evolution to this generation - - Meanwhile plants spring silently by the brook sides-and the grim woods wave indifferent-the earth emits no howl pot on fire simmers and seethes and men go about their business. - -</p>\n<p>Saturday March 19th 1842</p>\n<p>When I walk in the fields of Concord and meditate on the destiny of this prosperous slip of the Saxon <i>family</i>-the unexhausted energies of this new country-I forget that this which is now Concord was once Musketaquid and that the <i>American race</i> has had its destiny also. Everywhere in the fields-in the corn and grain land-the earth is strewn with the relics of a race which has vanished as completely as if trodden in with the earth.</p>\n<p>I find it good to remember the eternity behind me as well as the eternity before. Where ever I go I tread in the tracks of the Indian-I pick up the bolt which he has but just dropped at my feet. And if I consider destiny I am on his trail. I scatter his hearth stones with my feet, and pick out of the embers of his fire the simple but enduring implements of the wigwam and the chace-In planting my corn in the same furrow which yielded its increase to his support so long-I displace some memorial of him.</p>\n<p>I have been walking this afternoon over a pleasant field planted with winter rye-near the house. Where this strange people once had their dwelling place. Another species of mortal men but little less wild to me than the musquash they hunted-Strange spirits-daemons-whose eyes could never meet mine. With another nature-and another fate than mine- The crows flew over the edge of the woods, and wheeling over my head seemed to rebuke-as dark winged spirits more akin to the Indian than I. Perhaps only the present disguise of the Indian- If the new has a meaning so has the old.</p>\n<p>Nature has her russet hues as well as green-Indeed our eye splits on every object, and we can as well take one path as the other-If I consider its history it is old-if its destiny it is new-I may see a part of an object or the whole-I will not be imposed on and think nature is old, because the season is advanced I will study the botany of the mosses and fungi on the decayed-and remember that decayed wood is not old, but has just begun to be what it is. I need not think of the pine almond or the acorn and sapling when I meet the fallen pine or oak-more than of the generations of pines and oaks which have fed the young tree.</p>\n<p>The new blade of the corn-the third leaf of the melon-these are not green but gray with time, but sere in respect of time.</p>\n<p>September 12, 1851</p>\n<p>2 PM To the Three Friends' Hill beyond Flints Pond-via RR. RWEs Wood Path S side Walden-Geo Heywood's Cleared Lot &amp; Smith's orchards-return via E of Flints' P via Goose P &amp; my old home to RR-</p>\n<p>I go to Flints P. for the sake of the <i>Mt</i> view from the hill beyond looking over Concord. I have thought it the best especially in the winter which I can get in this neighborhood. It is worth the while to see the <i>Mts</i> in the horizon once a day. I have thus seen some earth which corresponds to my least earthly &amp; trivial-to my most heaven-ward looking thoughts-The earth seen through an azure an etherial veil. They are the natural <i>temples</i> elevated brows of the earth-looking at which the thoughts of the beholder are naturally elevated and etherialized. I wish to see the earth through the medium of much air or heaven-for there is no paint like the air. <i>Mts</i> thus seen are worthy of worship. I go to Flints' Pond also to see a rippling lake &amp; a reedy-island in its midst-Reed Island.</p>\n<p>A man should feed his senses with the best that the land affords</p>\n<p>At the entrance to the Deep Cut I heard the telegraph wire vibrating like an AÆolian Harp. It reminded me suddenly-reservedly with a beautiful paucity of communication-even silently, such was its effect on my thoughts-It reminded me, I say, with a certain pathetic moderation-of what finer &amp; deeper stirrings I was susceptible-which grandly set all argument &amp; dispute aside- -a triumphant though transient exhibition of the truth. It told me by the faintest imaginable strain-it told me by the finest strain that a human ear can hear-yet conclusively &amp; past all refutation-that there were higher infinitely higher plains of life-which it behoved me never to forget. As I was entering the Deep Cut the wind which was conveying a message to me from heaven dropt it on the wire of the telegraph which it vibrated as it past. I instantly sat down on a stone at the foot of the telegraph pole-&amp; attended to the communication. It merely said \"Bear in mind, Child &amp; never for an instant forget-that there are higher plains infinitely higher plains of life than this thou art now travelling on. Know that the goal is distant &amp; is upward and is worthy all your life's efforts to attain to.\" And then it ceased and though I sat some minutes longer I heard nothing more.</p>\n<p>There is every variety &amp; degree of inspiration from mere fullness of life to the most rapt mood. A human soul is played on even as this wire-which now vibrates slowly &amp; gently so that the passer can hardly hear it &amp; anon the sound swells &amp; vibrates with such intensity as if it would rend the wire-as far as the elasticity &amp; tension of the wire permits-and now it dies away and is silent-&amp; though the breeze continues to sweep over it, no strain comes from it-&amp; the traveller hearkens in vain. It is no small gain to have this wire stretched through Concord though there may be no Office here. Thus I make my own use of the telegraph-without consulting the Directors-like the sparrows which I perceive use it extensively for a perch.</p>\n<p>Shall I not go to this office to hear if there is any communication for me-as steadily as to the Post office in the village?</p>\n<p>Tuesday Dec 30th</p>\n<p>Mem. Go to the Deep Cut. The flies now crawl forth from the crevices all covered with dust, dreaming of summer-without life or energy enough to clean their wings</p>\n<p>This afternoon being on fair Haven Hill I heard the sound of a saw-and soon after from the cliff saw two men sawing down a noble pine beneath about 40 rods off. I resolved to watch it till it fell-the last of a dozen or more which were left when the forest was cut and for 15 years have waved in solitary majesty over the sproutland. I saw them like beavers or insects gnawing at the trunk of this noble tree, the diminutive mannikins with their crosscut saw which could scarcely span it. It towered up a hundred feet as I afterward found by measurement-one of the tallest probably now in the township &amp; straight as an arrow, but slanting a little toward the hill side.-its top seen against the frozen river &amp; the hills of Conantum. I watch closely to see when it begins to move. Now the sawers stop-and with an axe open it a little on the side toward which it leans that it may break the faster. And now their saw goes again-Now surely it is going-it is inclined one quarter of the quadrant, and breathless I expect its crashing fall-But no I was mistaken it has not moved an inch, it stands at the same angle as at first. It is 15 minutes yet to its fall. Still its branches wave in the wind as if it were destined to stand for a century, and the wind soughs through its needles as of yore; it is still a forest tree-the most majestic tree that waves over Musketaquid.-The silvery sheen of the sunlight is reflected from its needles-it still affords an inaccessible crotch for the squirrel's nest not a lichen has forsaken its mastlike stem- -its raking mast-the hill is the hull. Now's the moment the mannikins at its base are fleeing from their crime-they have dropped the guilty saw &amp; axe. How slowly &amp; majestically it starts-as if it were only swayed by a summer breeze and would return without a sigh to its location in the air-&amp; now it fans the hill side with its fall and it lies down to its bed in the valley from which it is never to rise, as softly as a feather, folding its green mantle about it like a warrior-as if tired of standing it embraced the earth with silent joy.-returning its elements to the dust again-but hark! there you only saw-but did not hear-There now comes up a deafening crash to these rocks-advertising you that even trees do not die without a groan. It rushes to embrace the earth, &amp; mingle its elements with the dust. And now all is still once more &amp; forever both to eye &amp; ear.</p>\n<p>I went down and measured it. It was about 4 feet in diameter where it was sawed-about 100 feet long. Before I had reached it-the axe-men had already half divested it of its branches. Its gracefully spreading top was a perfect wreck on the hill side as if it had been made of glass-&amp; the tender cones of one years growth upon its summit appealed in vain &amp; too late to the mercy of the chopper. Already he has measured it with his axe-and marked out the mill logs it will make. And the space it occupied in upper air is vacant for the next 2 centuries. It is lumber He has laid waste the air. When the fish hawk in the spring revisits the banks of the Musketaquid, he will circle in vain to find his accustomed perch.-&amp; the henhawk will mourn for the pines lofty enough to protect her brood. A plant which it has taken two centuries to perfect rising by slow stages into the heavens-has this afternoon ceased to exist. Its sapling top had expanded to this January thaw as the forerunner of summers to come. Why does not the village bell sound a knell. I hear no knell tolled-I see no procession of mourners in the streets-or the woodland aisles-The squirrel has leapt to another tree-the hawk has circled further off-&amp; has now settled upon a new eyre but the woodman is preparing to lay his axe at the root of that also.</p>\n<p>Dec 31st</p>\n<p>The 3d warm day. now overcast and beginning to drizzle. Still it is inspiriting as the brightest weather though the sun surely is not agoing to shine. There is a latent light in the mist-as if there were more electricity than usual in the air. These are warm foggy days in winter which excite us.</p>\n<p>It reminds me this thick spring like weather, that 1 have not enough valued and attended to the pure clarity &amp; brilliancy of the winter skies-Consider in what respects the winter sunsets differ from the summer ones. Shall I ever in summer evenings see so celestial a reach of blue sky contrasting with amber as I have seen a few days since-The day sky in winter corresponds for clarity to the night sky in which the stars shine &amp; twinkle so brightly in this latitude.</p>\n<p>I am too late perhaps, to see the sand foliage in the deep cut-should have been there day before yesterday-it is now too wet &amp; soft.</p>\n<p><i>(Continues...)</i></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote><br>\n Excerpted from <b>AMERICAN EARTH</b> by <b>Bill McKibben</b> Copyright © 2008 by Literary Classics of the United States, New York, NY..

Crumb, of Zap Comix fame, alongside lyrics by Marvin Gaye…Well selected, full of surprises and informed by McKibben's thoughtful commentary, <i>American Earth</i> is the first anthology of American nature writing to come close to the standard Thomas Lyon set two decades ago with <i>\"This Incomperable Lande\": A Book of American Nature Writing.</i> Ours is an incomparable land indeed, and McKibben's collection is a welcome reminder.<br>\n—The Washington Post\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4><p>In his introduction to this superb anthology, McKibben (<i>The End of Nature</i>) proposes that \"environmental writing is America's most distinctive contribution to the world's literature.\" The collected pieces amply prove the point. Arranged chronologically, McKibben's selection of more than 100 writers includes some of the great early conservationists, such as Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and John Burroughs, and many other eloquent nature writers, including Donald Cultross Peattie, Edwin Way Teale and Henry Beston. The early exponents of national parks and wilderness areas have their say, as do writers who have borne witness to environmental degradation-John Steinbeck and Caroline Henderson on the dust bowl, for example, and Berton Roueché and others who have reported on the effects of toxic pollution. Visionaries like Buckminster Fuller and Amory Lovins are represented, as are a wealth of contemporary activist/writers, among them Barry Lopez, Terry Tempest Williams, Barbara Kingsolver, Michael Pollan, Paul Hawken, and Calvin deWitt, cofounder of the Evangelical Environmental Network. McKibben's trenchant introductions to the pieces sum up each writer's thoughts and form a running commentary on the progress of the conservation movement. The book, being published on Earth Day, can be read as a survey of the literature of American environmentalism, but above all, it should be enjoyed for the sheer beauty of the writing. 80-page color illus, not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Apr. 22 [Earth Day])</i></p>\nCopyright 2007 Reed Business Information\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4><p>Adult/High School- There have been some excellent collections of nature writing published in recent years (<i>The Norton Anthology of Nature Writing</i> is one fine example), but not until now has there been a definitive anthology of American environmental writing. In this superbly edited volume, McKibben draws a clear distinction between the two. The best of the latter often celebrates nature, but also asks searching questions about the impact of human life on the planet. After a poignant foreword by Al Gore, as well as his own illuminating introduction, McKibben begins with the work of a writer, thinker, and activist ahead of his time, Henry David Thoreau, and ends the volume with Rebecca Solnit's essay, \"The Thoreau Problem.\" She notes that many people think of Thoreau only as a man alone observing nature, but the author of \"Civil Disobedience,\" before enjoying his day of huckleberry picking, spent a night in jail rather than pay taxes to a government guilty of ignoring the higher laws of nature. This vast and varied collection, arranged chronologically, includes many seminal names, such as John Muir, Rachel Carson, and Wendell Berry, and some that are less well known or unexpected, like Benton MacKaye, Caroline Henderson, P. T. Barnum, and Philip K. Dick. Most of the selections derive from longer prose works, but there is also a smattering of poems, song lyrics, and cartoons. Although the heft of the volume might scare away some teens, others may realize that they could easily read bits and pieces, and that they would benefit greatly by any amount of time spent in these pages. Numerous photographs, many in full color, are included.-<i>Robert Saunderson, Berkeley Public Library,CA</i></p>\n\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<b>The Best Poems of the English Language</b><br>\nFrom Chaucer Through Robert Frost \n<h3>Chapter One</h3>\n<h4>The Art of Reading Poetry</h4>\n<p>Poetry essentially is figurative language, concentrated so that its form is both expressive and evocative. Figuration is a departure from the literal, and the form of a great poem itself can be a trope (\"turning\") or figure. A common dictionary equivalent for \"figurative language\" is \"metaphorical,\" but a metaphor actually is a highly specific figure, or turning from the literal. Kenneth Burke, a profound student of rhetoric, or the language of figures, distinguished four fundamental tropes: irony, synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor. As Burke tells us, irony commits those who employ it to issues of presence and absence, since they are saying one thing while meaning something so different that it can be the precise opposite. We learn to wince when Hamlet says: \"I humbly thank you\" or its equivalent, since the prince generally is neither humble nor grateful.</p>\n<p>We now commonly call synecdoche \"symbol,\" since the figurative substitution of a part for a whole also suggests that incompletion in which something within the poem stands for something outside it. Poets frequently identify more with one trope than with the others. Among major American poets, Robert Frost (despite his mass reputation) favors irony, while Walt Whitman is the great master of synecdoche.</p>\n<p>In metonymy, contiguity replaces resemblance, since the name or prime aspect of anything is sufficient to indicate it, provided it is near in space to what serves as substitute. Childe Roland, in Browning's remarkable monologue, is represented at the very end by the \"slug-horn\" ortrumpet upon which he dauntlessly blows: \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.\"</p>\n<p>Metaphor proper transfers the ordinary associations of one word to another, as when Hart Crane beautifully writes \"peonies with pony manes,\" enhancing his metaphor by the pun between \"peonies\" and \"pony.\" Or again Crane, most intensely metaphorical of poets, refers to the Brooklyn Bridge's curve as its \"leap,\" and then goes on to call the bridge both harp and altar.</p>\n<p>Figurations or tropes create meaning, which could not exist without them, and this making of meaning is largest in authentic poetry, where an excess or overflow emanates from figurative language, and brings about a condition of newness. Owen Barfield's <i>Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning</i> is one of the best guides to this process, when he traces part of the poetic history of the English word \"ruin.\"</p>\n<p>The Latin verb <i>ruo</i>, meaning \"rush\" or \"collapse,\" led to the substantive <i>ruina</i> for what had fallen. Chaucer, equally at home in French and English, helped to domesticate \"ruin\" as \"a falling\":</p>\n<blockquote>Min is the ruine of the highe halles,<br>\n The falling of the towers and of the walles.</blockquote>\n<p>One feels the chill of that, the voice being Saturn's or time's in \"The Knight's Tale.\" Chaucer's disciple Edmund Spenser, has the haunting line:</p>\n<blockquote>The old ruines of a broken tower</blockquote>\n<p>My last selection in this book is Hart Crane's magnificent death ode, \"The Broken Tower,\" in which Spenser's line reverberates. Barfield emphasizes Shakespeare's magnificence in the employment of \"ruin,\" citing \"Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang\" from Sonnet 73, and the description of Cleopatra's effect upon her lover: \"The noble ruin of her magic, Antony.\" I myself find even stronger the blind Gloucester's piercing outcry when he confronts the mad King Lear (IV, VI, 134135):</p>\n<blockquote>O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world<br>\n Shall so wear out to nought.</blockquote>\n<p>Once Barfield sets one searching, the figurative power of \"ruined\" seems endless. Worthy of Shakespeare himself is John Donne, in his \"A Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's Day,\" where love resurrects the poet to his ruin:</p>\n<blockquote>Study me then, you who shall lovers be<br>\n At the next world, that is, at the next spring:<br>\n For I am every dead thing,<br>\n In whom love wrought new alchemy.<br>\n For his art did express<br>\n A quintessence even from nothingness,<br>\n From dull privations, and lean emptiness<br>\n He ruined me, and I am re-begot<br>\n Of absence, darkness, death; things which are not.</blockquote>\n<p>Barfield invokes what he rightly calls Milton's \"terrific phrase\": \"Hell saw / Heaven ruining from Heaven,\" and then traces Wordsworth's allusive return to Milton. Rather than add further instances, I note Barfield's insight, that the figurative power of \"ruin\" depends upon restoring its original sense of <i>movement</i>, of rushing toward a collapse. One of the secrets of poetic rhetoric in English is to romance the etonym (as it were), to renew what Walter Pater called the \"finer edges\" of words.</p>\n<i><b>The Best Poems of the English Language</b><br>\nFrom Chaucer Through Robert Frost</i>.
