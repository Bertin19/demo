Characters reveal dignity and doubt in extraordinary situations, including a grandmother who abandons her frail husband in order to carry her grandchildren to safety in Nadine Gordimer's powerful \"The Ultimate Safari.\" J. M. Coetzee's \"Nietverloren\" examines the changing face of Africa through the demise of a small family farm. Binyavanga Wainaina's \"Discovering Home,\" meanwhile, contrasts a young man's year at home in Kenya after several years of cosmopolitan Cape Town life. Despite a rich diversity of style and subject matter, each story, as described in Ben Okri's introduction, \"reveals what hides in people,\" offering intimate glimpses into an array of African lives.

It is a critical addition to the study of African and Caribbean women’s literatures at a time when women from these regions are actively engaged in articulating the ways in which colonial and postcolonial violence impact women.&nbsp;Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.",

Long live the African storytellers!\" &#151; Africa Today<P>\"It is difficult to imagine a more practical introduction to contemporary African epic than this anthology... no other single volume comprehends the full scope of African epic (as opposed to praise poetry) the way this one does.... The stories are engaging, and the free-verse translations are surprisingly readable.... Recommended for all academic collections.\" &#151; Choice<P>Western culture traces its literary heritage to such well-known epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey and Gilgamesh. But it is only recently that scholars have turned their attention toward capturing the rich oral tradition that is still alive in Africa today. These 25 selections introduce English-speaking readers to the extensive epic traditions in Africa.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>Third installment of major literary and scholarly project exposes East African women's history and culture.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The third volume from the Women Writing Africa Project makes a significant contribution to the study of African literature and offers a textured portrait of women's lives in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. These pieces span the centuries from 1711 to 2003, address topics ranging from religion to HIV and represent prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, lullabies and protest songs. Marriage is a theme that runs throughout: \"A Mother's Advice and Prayer\" from 1858 is a nuptial manual in verse, and \"I Want a Divorce,\" taken from a 1922 court record, gives a valuable glimpse of the power struggles between husband and wife. On a lighter note, a collection of recent song lyrics complains about useless husbands and lovers. Many 20th-century writers address colonialism and independence: Penina Muhando Mlama's \"Creating in the Mother-Tongue\" looks at the linguistic, literary and socioeconomic obstacles to writing in indigenous languages. The editors' lucid introduction usefully contextualizes these wonderful writings, and this volume will be especially welcome in college classrooms. General readers who want to be entertained, educated and chastened about women's struggles and triumphs in east Africa will delight in this literary feast. <I>(July)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Patrick Henry Bass</h4>Cultural critic Kevin Powell's <i>Step into a World</i> is a watershed moment in hip-hop writing, a thought-provoking book with a broad range of voices, from Ben Okri to Junot Didaz. <br>\n— <i>Essence</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This anthology of young, contemporary black writers generally maintains a precarious balance between authentic discovery and promotional marketing, although the writing varies widely in quality and relevance (some selections are quite riveting, others just self-absorbed). Divided into six sections--\"Essays,\" \"Hip-Hop Journalism,\" \"Criticism,\" \"Fiction,\" \"Poetry,\" and \"Dialogue\"--the collection presents a broad range of voices and perspectives, although a majority of them are, not surprisingly, from the United States. While some of the texts, particularly those on hip-hop, seem overly dramatic and hyperbolic, some very fine writing emerges in the \"Essays\" section. Mostly autobiographical, these selections address the very real contemporary problems of black identity in a post-Civil Rights era in which the political battle lines have become much more blurred and the issues of self, nation, class, gender, sexuality, and history are immensely complicated. The items in the \"Dialogue\" section are the most strident and the most inventive and compelling. Even though this book will mainly be used as a classroom textbook, it could be a valuable addition to larger collections and other libraries interested in offering brief introductions to young black writers.--Roger A.

    "synopsis": "<p><p>A white knight meets his half-black half-brother in battle. A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of <B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B>.<p> <p>This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from <I>Arabian Nights</I> and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume.<p> <p><B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B> allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning.<p> <p>Contributors include&#58; Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sollors (English literature & Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, \"It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics.\" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967.

In this fascinating retrospective collection, she shares her personal journey through the social and political landscapes of the 1980s, with its recollected moments of struggle and transformation along the way. Written in a variety of styles and voices, ranging from anecdotal memory to historical moment to folklore tradition, these simply presented poems and stories are by turns funny, touching, chilling, thought-provoking and absorbing. Love Child is a collection for the new millennium generation. It is valuable not just for the deeply-felt personal and political insights it has to offer, but for the accessible ease with which it manages to capture the seminal moments of black South African history in the preserving amber of the author's personal recollection.</p>",

Each of the 120 texts in the volume is accompanied by a scholarly note that provides detailed background information, while an introductory essay sets the broader historical stage. Approximately one third of the texts are oral in origin, and few have previously been available in book form.</p>",
    "excerpt": "",
    "synopsis": "<p><P>An essential text for libraries&#151;the definitive collection of women's literatures from southern Africa.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<p>Female characters who suffer madness and insanity are strikingly prominent in novels by women writers of Africa and the Caribbean. To find out why there are so many \"suffocated hearts and tortured souls\" in this literature, Valerie Orlando, who has long studied Francophone text and culture, here closely reads the work of Aminata Sow Fall, Mariama Bâ, Myrian Warner-Vieyra, and Simone Schwarz-Bart, among others. In these women's novels, Orlando finds, madness is the manifestation of a split identity, and in this study she sets herself the task of interrogating the nature of that identity. Francophone women novelists of Africa and the Caribbean—though they come from countries whose unique experiences of colonialism, revolution, and postcolonial regimes have shaped specific and discrete cultures—express a common search for a meaningful relationship between their experience as women to the history and destiny of their nations. Only when \"woman\"' is understood not as an ahistorical object but as a subject whose lived body is entwined with political, cultural, and economic structures, Orlando argues, will insanity finally give way to clarity of being. Interweaving literary citations with theoretical discussion, Suffocated Hearts and Tortured Souls is just as much a masterful explication of profoundly affecting literary work as it is an essential addition to feminist scholarship and theory.</p>",

In so doing, he opens up relatively uncharted terrain in African literary studies. Comprehensive, nuanced, occasionally lyrical, the book covers an impressive range of hitherto neglected francophone novels that are examined alongside canonical anglophone texts. The author places these texts in their colonial and postcolonial contexts, developing upon, and linking, structuralist theories of colonialism and patriarchy. This study offers a radical new position for those scholars who have long sought alternatives to the liberal humanist bias pervading many studies of African women's writing.<p>Students often struggle with the models employed by feminist and postcolonial theorists such as Judith Butler and Homi Bhabha. The clarity with which Harrow explains the positions of such theorists makes his book an essential companion to, and commentary upon, their publications. Kenneth Harrow's study will be of interest not only to African literature specialists, but also to non-literary scholars concerned with questions about feminism, gender construction, colonialism, psychoanalysis, and postcolonial theory.<p></p>",

It would be a shame to deprive today's children of this newly illustrated collection, endorsed by leading black authors, educators, and political leaders, because of the occasional use of this word. Most beautiful is the story of the Prodigal Son, told with a dramatic simplicity that's just right for readers' theater: the wastrel son's return and celebration, the good son's complaint to his father (\"I work, I work, I work, I never left you. All the time you never kill one small goat for me. How you do me so?\"), and the moving reply (\"He was dead and now he live. He ain't got nothin. And he hungry\").

A book to share across generations.<br>\n—(<i>Booklist</i>)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Children&#039;s Literature</h4>These poems, first published in 1946, are at times profound or humorous, but each reflects the uncomplicated view of an African child recounting the Biblical stories in his own way. As Graham presents the poems, the reader (or better the listener) is aware of the importance of the oral tradition in the West African culture. Graham, a missionary to West Africa in the 1920s, heard the stories and wanted others to share them. In this newly published edition, Ashley Bryan adds detailed black-and-white blockprints to offer visual images to accompany the text. Each story is accompanied by one full-page print. Because of the dialect used by Graham, these stories lend themselves to being read aloud or told. One might question the use of dialect, but Graham's introduction presents the origin of the dialect and offers the proper argument for its use. This new edition would be a worthy addition to a body of African literature. 2000 (orig. 1946), Boyds Mills Press, Ages 5 to 8, $17.95. Reviewer: Jenny B. Petty\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>Gr 4 Up-A newly illustrated edition of a 1946 title. Using the vernacular English of West Africa in the 1920s, Graham eschewed \"Uncle Remus\" phonetic spelling, but preserved the idiomatic and idiosyncratic grammar of Sudanic coastal groups (Mandingo, Golah, Kru). Excerpts may sound awkward (\"Now you mens they dead,\" Naomi tells Ruth), but the ear catches on quickly to the meaning of the phrases sung in poetic rhythms. Biblical order is not followed, so the Prodigal Son appears between two Moses episodes, rather than as a Christian parable; only brief accounts of the Nativity, the lost boy-Jesus, and the loaves and fishes come from the New Testament. All of the stories focus on relationships. There is unexpected humor (Goliath's question to David, \"Do you mommy know you out?), drama (Goliath's protracted fall), and poignancy (David's mourning). Solomon's wisdom; Joshua's leadership; and the stories of Joseph, Esther, Job, Elisha, and Cain and Abel are among those memorably retold. Bryan's blockprints communicate a simplicity and strength in harmony with the text. Highly decorative in their intricate design, they also recognize the central character and dramatic moment in each story: Daniel embracing the lions, Isaac embracing Jacob. This book conveys a distinctive flavor of West African culture, and offers fresh, piquant seasoning for familiar Bible tales.-Patricia Lothrop-Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><p>A white knight meets his half-black half-brother in battle. A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of <B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B>.<p> <p>This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from <I>Arabian Nights</I> and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume.<p> <p><B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B> allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning.<p> <p>Contributors include&#58; Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sollors (English literature & Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, \"It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics.\" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967. As stated in a Rita Dove play: \"A sniff of freedom's all it takes to feel history's sting.\" Recommended for academic libraries and for any reader working around the race rubric.-Scott Hightower, Fordham Univ., New York Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

    "overview": "<br>\nFiction. African American Studies. Translated from the French. AMONG THE BLACKS consists of two works: Ron Padgett's translation of Raymond Roussel's early story \"Parmi les noirs,\" first published in 1935 in his book Comment j'ai ecrit certain de mes livres, together with Padgett's memoir focusing upon his own experience among black people. Roussel's story, about a master mariner named White who encounters an African chief named Booltable, is built upon the kind of whimsical and extravagant word play (its first and last sentences are identical except for one letter in one word--\"pooltable\"/ \"Booltable\") for which Roussel was idolized by the French Surrealists. In contrast, as he writes in his Afterword, Padgett's memoir \"grew out of the nagging need to come to grips with the frustrations of being a white American who had grown up in a racist environment and who, despite his rejections of racism at an early age, had rarely felt unselfconscious in the company of a black person.\" \"What he leaves us with is a work that is like the perfectly preserved temple of a cult which has disappeared without a trace, or a complicated set of tools whose use cannot be discovered. But even though we may never be able to 'use' [Roussel's] work in the way he hoped, we can still admire its inhuman beauty, and be stirred by a language that seems always on the point of revealing its secret, of pointing the way back to the 'republic of dreams' whose insignia blazed on his forehead\"--John Ashbery.",

Who created us? Why are we here?

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Starred Review. \n<p>Eight-time Emmy-winner Stewart (America: The Book) seeks to expand his audience to aliens who might land on earth after the extinction of the human race and be puzzled over the artifacts we've left behind. \"Greetings... on behalf of not only ourselves, but the entire Viacom family,\" he writes in this laugh-out-loud, rollicking social satire. In place of skits there are elaborate, color illustrations accompanied by captions written with his trademark deadpan humor; for instance, a photo of a mother and baby-elephant holds the caption, \"advances in contraception and industrialized food production allowed modern couples to have fewer offspring, while leaving the total weight of families constant.\" Nothing is off-limits here, not even Benjamin Franklin, whose pithy saying \"Nothing is certain but death and taxes\" Stewart expands upon. The book ends with a plea to the aliens to reconstruct the human race from DNA in the hope that, with guidance from the visitors, \"we could overcome the baser aspects of our nature... and give this planet the kind of caretakers it deserves,\" revealing the tears behind Stewart's clown.

All rights reserved.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>E.W.com</h4>Has it really been a full six years since Jon Stewart and the writers of <i>The Daily Show</i> released their last book? Well, the delay's understandable. It's a daunting task to cover the history of a 4.5 billion-year-old planet (including the entirety of human existence) in 244 pages.\n<p>You'll recognize <i>Earth's</i> faux-textbook design and irreverent tone from <i>America (The Book),</i> and some gags recur nearly unchanged — the terrifyingly nude bodies of the Supreme Court justices are replaced here with the terrifyingly nude body of Larry King. But the subject's bigger, and the high concept higher. <i>Earth</i> is written as a Baedeker for the aliens who will eventually discover our planet after our species has expired, likely by our own hand. All the entries, hitting topics like love (''liking another person very very very very very very much'') and work (''that which we didn't want to do, but had to, if we didn't want to eat dirt''), are written in the past tense. It's the ultimate gallows humor: We had it pretty good, and now we're all dead.</p>\n<p><i>Earth</i> is The Devil's Dictionary for a new generation, twisting our lives in the light and bringing mordant humor to the commonplace. Despite the timelessness of most topics, the writers manage to be pretty lively at times, such as when they refer to the Grand Canyon as ''the biggest rift in Arizona not involving Mexicans.''</p>\n<p> <i>Earth</i> isn't meant to be read straight through. It's designed to be perused, so you can discover at your leisure all the fun gags and wordplay crammed into its nooks and crannies. Because there are a lot. Enough, in fact, to make you believe this would actually be a fairly comprehensive guide for extraterrestrial visitors, just so long as they have a sense of humor. A–--(Staskiewicz, Keith)</p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Following the 2004 Publishers Weekly Book of the Year America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction—the Hachette Audio version of which won a Grammy Award—Stewart and the writers of his celebrated Daily Show together narrate this satirical overview of humanity written as though it were being explained to aliens of the future who discover Earth after the demise of all human life. Stewart, the primary narrator, explains religion, history, commerce, government, customs, and society in his trademark delivery. Unfortunately, he often swallows his punch lines, thus defeating the efficacy of many of the jokes. Perhaps his brand of humor is better suited to television. Nonetheless, this is a timely and entertaining title sure to do well among Stewart's many fans, who will doubtless laugh along. Recommended. [The Grand Central hc was a No. 1 New York Times and LJ best seller; see the review of the Grand Central hc, also in this issue, p. 122.—Ed.]—J. Sara Paulk, Wythe-Grayson Regional Lib., Independence, VA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4><p>A goofy guide to our planet, with literate ironist Stewart (<em>America: The Book</em>, 2004) at the helm.</p>\n<p>Continuing in the vein of<em>America</em>, but with a touch more detail in both words and images, Stewart and his<em>Daily Show</em>comrades posit that someday soon the ETs we've been hailing for all these decades will arrive—only to find us gone. And why would we not be here? Well, Stewart relegates the possible answers to an appendix that opens, \"At some point between the time this was written and the time you are reading it, we perished.\" Some of those possibilities include ecological catastrophe, nuclear holocaust, disease, robot rebellion and rapture—the last with a generous 30:1 chance of occurring, and evidenced by an \"overall 'Jesus-y' feeling in the air.\" To gauge by the rest of the book, however, the end may well come by dint of our soufflé-like culture's having finally become too airy and collapsed. So it is that<em>Earth</em>is studded with images of all those pop-culture and media figures that one would gladly leave the planet to escape, from Bernie Madoff to Nicole Kidman and J-Lo (or, if not J-Lo, a convincing simulacrum). Stewart lampoons with a broad brush rather than the scalpel with which he dissects pomposity and prevarication on his Comedy Central show. Some of his targets include creationists and school boards, fast-food restaurants, obesity, the medical bureaucracy, the Venus of Willendorf and, not connected to the aforementioned Venus, the use of the brassiere as an instrument of social control. George Bush doesn't escape, of course; but then, neither does Florence Henderson.</p>\n<p>The legions of readers of<em>America</em> will know exactly what they're in for—and readers of whatever stripe, save those who are fans of McDonald's and Satan, are likely to enjoy this one.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Janet Maslin</h4>Like the \"Daily Show\" this parody delivers wittily framed absurdities in a sweetly deadpan way…like the show, [it's] best when it takes on subjects of real substance…That's why the funniest material is about religion and science.<br>\n—The New York Times\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><P>David Wagoner writes about regular lives with plain grace and transcendent humanity, and the seventy-five poems he has chosen for the 2009 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> grapple with life, celebrate freedom, and teem with imaginative energy. With engaging notes from the poets, Wagoner's superb introductory essay, series editor David Lehman's astute foreword about the current state of poetry and criticism, and cover art from the beloved poet John Ashbery, <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i> is a memorable and delightful addition to a series dedicated to showcasing the work of poets at their best.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>From the moment series editor David Lehman invokes the myth of Jacob wrestling the Angel in his introduction, the gloves are off in this year's installment of this popular annual anthology. Lehman devotes much of his introduction to throwing jabs at longtime sparring partner and professional poetry grump William Logan, whom Lehman calls &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin skinned.&rdquo; Guest editor Wagoner chooses to abstain from the scuffle, but there's no denying the aesthetic character amassed by the poems he's selected&#58; American poets not only want to talk about their country this year, they want to talk violence in (and toward) their country. &ldquo;They came to blow up America,&rdquo; writes John Ashbery, followed hard on his heels by Mark Bibbins, who warns our fifth state, &ldquo;Connecticut! we're sawing you in half.&rdquo; Denise Duhamel envisions &ldquo;How It Will End&rdquo; (&ldquo;We look around, but no one is watching us&rdquo;) and Rob Cook, in his bold and incantatory &ldquo;Song of America,&rdquo; tells us, &ldquo;I'm raising my child to drown and drop dead and to carry buildings on his back.&rdquo; It appears our poets are at last ready to confront the hysteria and violence of the past eight years, and who can say there's a better year than 2009 to begin.

    "synopsis": "<p><P>\"How ironic,\" Joyce Carol Oates writes in her introduction to this marvelous collection, \"that in our age of rapid mass-production and the easy proliferation of consumer products, the richness and diversity of the American literary imagination should be so misrepresented in most anthologies.\" Why, she asks, when writers such as Samuel Clemens, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? \"Isn't the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?\"<br> In <b>The Oxford Book of American Short Stories</b>, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many \"different, unexpected\" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle,\" Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" and Hemingway's \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\" But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's \"Cannibalism in the Cars,\" a story that reveals a darker side to his humor (\"That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy\"). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,\" of which Oates says, \"Only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction.\" From Flannery O'Connor we find \"A Late Encounter With the Enemy,\" and from John Cheever, \"The Death of Justina,\" one of Cheever's own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master.<br> This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In these lean times, it is difficult to imagine many libraries champing at the bit to purchase yet another anthology of American short stories. But institutions seeking to expand the diversity of their holdings in this area may find this collection the perfect choice. ``Familiar names, unfamiliar titles'' is the raison d'etre for this new volume. Along with some old chestnuts such as ``The Tell-Tale Heart'' and ``A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,'' editor Oates presents many fresh selections such as Edith Wharton's ``The Journey'' and John Cheever's ``The Death of Justina.'' She includes lesser-known minority and women writers such as Jean Toomer and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman alongside stories by newcomers Amy Tan, Louise Erdrich, and David Leavitt. Each author is given a brief biographical introduction. Recommended for serious literary collections.-- Rita Ciresi, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park</p>",

The modest two-by-three-foot model came with wall brackets and a three-piece starter box of chalk. Its deluxe cousin was framed in wood, had legs and feet, and came \"loaded\": a pair of erasers, a pointer, a twelve-stick chalk set, and a bonus box of colored chalk. I was a third-grader when I spotted that blackboard. Good-bye to Lincoln Logs and Louisville Sluggers. From the age of eight, I wanted to teach.</p>\n<p>My first students were my older sisters. As preteenagers, Gail and Vita were more interested in imitating the dance steps of the American Bandstand \"regulars\" than in playing school, but a direct order from our mother sent them trudging upstairs to my classroom. I'd prepared for their arrival: work sheets, white shirt and clip-on tie, alarm clock hidden under my bed for the surprise fire drill. If my sisters had to play, then they would playact. Vita cast herself as hip-swiveling Cookie Crane, as smoldering a third-grader as there ever was. Gail was Rippy Van Snoot, the class incorrigible. I was launching into opening exercises when Rippy reached past me, grabbed a blackboard eraser, and bounced it off my forehead. Cookie shrieked with delight and lit an imaginary cigarette. I forget which reprobate flung my flash cards into the air and made the room rain arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Fourteen years later I was a high school English teacher with my first actual students. Paula Plunkett and Seth Jinks were the two I remember most vividly from my rookie year. Paula had pretty eyes and graceful penmanship, but she was encased in a fortress of fat. Sad and isolated, she sat at a special table in back because she didn't fit the desks. She never spoke; no one ever spoke to her. In my first-year-teacher naïveté, I sought to draw Paula into the dynamic, thinking group work and class discussion would save her. My plan failed miserably.</p>\n<p>Seth Jinks was in the twelfth-grade class I'd been assigned because I had no seniority. \"The sweathogs,\" these kids dubbed themselves. I was twenty-one, and so were three or four of my sweathogs. We honeymooned for a couple of weeks. Then one morning I walked up the aisle and tapped Seth Jinks on the shoulder. I needed to wake him up so I could exchange the paperback he hadn't read for the new one he wasn't going to read. \"Seth, get your head off the desk,\" I said. \"Here's the new book.\" No response. I poked him. He looked up at me with little-boy-lost eyes. \"Go fuck yourself,\" he said. The room went quiet. The sweathogs, Seth, and I held our collective breath and waited for my response. And in that uneasy silence, and the days, and months, and decades that followed, teaching became for me not just a job but a calling. I have found special meaning in working with hard nuts, tough cookies, and hurtin' buckaroos - those children among us who are the walking wounded.</p>\n<p>That said, I did not want to go to York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's maximum-security prison for women, on that warm August afternoon in 1999. I was keeping a promise I'd made to Marge Cohen, the prison school librarian. Marge had called three months earlier, as I was preparing for a twelve-city book tour in support of my second novel, I Know This Much Is True. Several suicides and suicide attempts had triggered an epidemic of despair at the prison, Marge had explained; the school staff, groping to find help, was canvasing the community. They thought writing might prove useful to the women as a coping tool. Would I come and speak? Because I'm frequently asked to support good causes and have a hard time saying no, I keep an index card taped to my phone - a scripted refusal that allows me to preserve family and writing time. That day, though, I couldn't find my card. I told Marge I'd visit when I got back from my book tour.</p>\n<p>I would never have predicted an author's life for myself, but when I was thirty, while on summer hiatus from teaching, I'd sat down and written a short story on a whim. I liked doing it and wrote another. For my third story, I fused a sarcastic voice to the visual memory of the mute, isolated Paula Plunkett. For years I had worried and wondered about my former student. What had become of her? What had all that weight meant? Who had she been as a child? In the absence of actual knowledge, the life I invented around her remembered image became my first novel, She's Come Undone. It took me nine years to figure out the story of that bruised fictional soul whom I'd fathered and then grown to love and worry over. I loved and stewed over the flawed identical twins of my second novel, too - one of whom had a generous measure of Seth Jinks's anger. What I did not see coming was that the world would embrace these characters also. \"Hello, Wally? Guess what?\" The caller on the other end of the phone line was Oprah Winfrey. She called twice, once for each novel. The result: best-seller lists, limo rides, movie deals, and foreign translations. Oprah's Book Club had taken my life by the seat of the pants and sent me on the road.</p>\n<p>Rock stars on tour bust up their hotel rooms. They get drunk or high, trash the furniture with their bandmates, party with groupies. But authors on tour are quieter, more solitary souls. Between appointments, we sit by ourselves in our rooms, nibbling like prairie dogs on room service sandwiches, or ironing our clothes for the next reading, or watching Judge Judy. Perhaps the most surreal moment during my book tour that summer occurred in a hotel room in Dayton, Ohio. While channel-surfing, I came upon the quiz show Jeopardy! at the exact moment my name surfaced. \"He wrote the novel She's Come Undone,\" Alex Trebek stated. In the long and torturous pause that followed, the three contestants stood there, lockjawed and mute, itching but unable to press their thumbs to their buzzers. And sitting on the edge of the bed in room 417 of the Westin Hotel, I uttered in a sheepish voice, \"Who is Wally Lamb?\"</p>\n<p>I'm a family man, a fiction writer, a teacher, and a guy who can't say no without the index card. On that nervous first drive to York Correctional Institution, I sought to calm myself with music. I was fumbling with CD cases and radio buttons when suddenly, over the airwaves, a piano pounded and the car shook with the vocal thunder of Newark, New Jersey's Abyssinian Baptist Choir. The unfamiliar song so overpowered me that I pulled to the shoulder to listen. When it ended, I looked up at the highway sign in front of which I'd landed. correctional facility area, it said. do not stop. The inexplicable emotional wallop of that moment fills me with wonder to this day.</p>\n<p>To gain access to the women of York prison, you check in with the guard at the main gate, hang your laminated badge on your shirt pocket, walk through a metal detector, then pass through a series of ten doors, some of which slide open mysteriously after you stand and wait. You don't see who's flipping the switches, so it's an Orwellian entrance. At the prison school, I met my liaison, Dale Griffith, a warm and exuberant English teacher. Dale and I arranged the chairs in a circle, a uniformed corrections officer bellowed orders from the corridor, and thirty inmates entered the room.</p>\n<p>Dressed identically in cranberry T-shirts and pocketless jeans, the women came in all colors, shapes, sizes, and degrees of gender identification. Their attitudes ranged from hangdog to Queen of Sheba. Most had shown up not to write but to check out \"that guy who was on Oprah.\" I spoke. We tried some exercises. I asked if anyone had questions about writing. Several hands shot into the air. \"You met Oprah?\" \"What's Oprah like?\" \"Oprah's cool, you know what I'm sayin'?\" Uh, was that a question?</p>\n<p>At the end of my talk, one of the women stood, thanked me for coming, and pitched me a curveball. \"You coming back?\" she asked. Thirty pairs of wary eyes were upon me and my index card was back in my office. \"Uh, well . . . okay,\" I said. \"Write something and I'll see you in two weeks. Any subject, two pages minimum. Your drafts will be your tickets into the workshop.\"</p>\n<p>At session two, fifteen of the thirty chairs were empty. Stacie wanted praise, not feedback. Manhattan said she'd meant to be vague and nonspecific - that her business wasn't necessarily the reader's business. Ruth must have thought she was a guest on Oprah; she'd written only a paragraph, but man oh man, did she want to talk. At age fifty-five Diane was the senior member of the group. For ninety minutes she hunched forward, fists clenched on her desktop. Her suspicious eyes followed my every move. Diane had written under the pseudonym Natasha and had exacted a promise before class that her work would never, ever be read aloud. I predicted she'd be gone by session three.</p>\n<p>But it was during session three that Diane Bartholomew (\"Snapshots of My Early Life\") couldn't keep her writing to herself. Her shaky hand went up and she asked if she could share what she'd written. In a barely audible voice, she read a disjointed, two-page summary of her horrific life story: incest, savage abuse, spousal homicide, lawyerly indifference, and, in prison, parallel battles against breast cancer and deep, dark depression. When she stopped, there was silence, a communal intake of breath. Then, applause - a single pair of hands at first, joined by another pair, and then by everyone. Bartholomew had sledgehammered the dam of distrust, and the women's writing began to flow.</p>\n<p>That was three years ago. I stopped counting sessions somewhere around number fifty. Writers have come and gone: the narcotics-addicted nurse who wrote a moving apologia to a deceased aunt whose support had never wavered; the high school athlete who, a month after graduation, brandished her softball bat during a convenience store robbery and wrote to figure out why; the young alcoholic mother who time-traveled, penning a personal letter to one of the prison's original 1917 inmates, also an alcoholic. The workshop sessions have been a journey rich with laughter, tears, heart-stopping leaps of faith, and miraculous personal victories. There have been bumps in the road, too. Addicts are elusive; they tend to begin promising drafts, take them to some interesting midway point, then give up on themselves and stop coming. There have been trust issues. Prison is not a place where trust is given easily, and a writer who shares her work in progress risks exposure. That risk taking must be honored. Only the writer should decide when, and if, her work is ready for the eyes and ears of nongroup members - ready, in other words, to go public. If another group member breaches that trust, she has to leave. Similarly, a few con artists and drama queens have been handed their walking papers. A functional writing community cannot accommodate the needs of would-be superstars or instigators of the guess-what-she-said-about-you variety. But those have been the exceptions. The brave writers whose work is represented in this volume have acted in good faith, faced their demons, stayed the course, and revised relentlessly. And in taking on the subject of themselves - making themselves vulnerable to the unseen reader - they have exchanged powerlessness for the power that comes with self-awareness.</p>\n<p>\"I started writing because of a terrible feeling of powerlessness,\" the novelist Anita Brookner has said. The National Book Award winner Alice McDermott noted that the most difficult thing about becoming a writer was convincing herself that she had anything to say that people would want to read. \"There's nothing to writing,\" the columnist Red Smith once commented. \"All you do is sit down at a typewriter and open a vein.\"</p>\n<p>Michelle Jessamy (\"Motherlove\") was fourteen when she became pregnant by her teenage boyfriend. Despite the challenges, Jessamy's impending motherhood helped her get closer to her own emotionally distant mother. As she drafted her memory piece, that mother-daughter epiphany emerged as the centerpiece. Then, mid-draft, Jessamy hit a snag. She began writing a flashback to an earlier instance of sexual abuse - a hallway molestation by a friend of the family when she was eleven. The painful incident was integral to the story she needed to tell, but disclosing her long-kept secret made Jessamy feel uncomfortable. She stopped writing. But self-censorship felt uncomfortable, too. Jessamy had worked hard on her essay and wanted to see it through. The solution? A change of genre. On paper, Jessamy became Mo'Shay Shambly, and the pronoun I became she. Mo'Shay had the same hazel eyes as Michelle, the same experiences. But now Jessamy was writing autobiographical fiction. That little bit of distance unblocked her and she finished her piece.</p>\n<p>Brenda Medina (\"Hell, and How I Got Here\") was self-censoring like Michelle Jessamy, but for a very different reason. For months after she joined our group, she labored on the same short essay about the death of her uncle Carlos - draft after draft after draft. One day I suggested to Medina that, God bless him, I didn't think I had the strength to attend to poor Uncle Carlos's death one more time. \"There's something else I want to write about, but I can't,\" she told me. That \"something\" was what had landed her in prison ten years earlier at age seventeen: her affiliation with a violent street gang.</p>\n<p>York Correctional Institution is vigilant in its efforts to eliminate gang influence within the compound. Incarcerated gang members who choose to uphold their allegiance to \"the family\" pay a steep price in the form of punitive segregation, loss of privileges, and loss of the \"good time\" that can shorten their stay on the inside. A self-described punk when she arrived at York, Brenda Medina had traveled a long and difficult road as an inmate, freeing herself from the psychological grip of her \"family\" and undertaking the rigorous step-by-step process by which an inmate repudiates her gang affiliation and begins rehabilitation in earnest. Even mentioning the name of a gang can cast suspicion that the inmate has reneged on her disaffiliation. Medina's very real fear was that, if she wrote about her past life, her work might be seized, taken out of context, and misconstrued as gang-friendly. If that happened, she could lose much of what she had worked so hard to achieve. My collaborator, Dale Griffith, dealt with the problem directly. She sought and received permission from prison officials for Medina to take up her gang experience as subject matter. With that hurdle cleared, the writer was on her way to a personal essay that, far from glorifying gangs, depicts their insidious hold on young people's lives and the cancerous destruction of their futures.</p>\n<p>In her much-loved book on writing, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, Anne Lamott observes: \"We write to expose the unexposed.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n Excerpted from <b>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</b> by <b>Wally Lamb and the Women of the York Correctional Institution</b> Copyright © 2003 by Wally Lamb<br>\n Excerpted by permission.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>Wally Lamb's novels <i>She's Come Undone</i> and <i>I Know This Much Is True</i> were both Oprah's Book Club selections and No. 1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. On the surface, <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i> is far different than these works of fiction. In this heart-wrenching collection, Lamb introduces and presents 11 female writers who happen to be convicted felons. Their pieces, as potent as their personalities, would be less accessible without Lamb's modest and disarming preludes. \"Prison,\" he writes, \"is not a place where trust is given easily.\" Obviously, he earned that trust, and we now share its fruits.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>The Los Angeles Times</h4>One truth this book affirms is the capacity for people to change. The writers of <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i> chart their own journeys of growth, navigating the terrain of their internal worlds, their pasts and present prison realities. Who they have become is clear both in self-awareness and what they do with their lives — teaching others, advocacy, computer work, construction in prison and out. It is in this change that hope resides; lying next to and rising out of despair, hope permeates the book. Why, in the end, does Lamb want us to care about 10 women in prison? Perhaps because in noticing the humanity of others, we become more human ourselves. — <i>Kathy Boudin</i>\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Bestselling author and Oprah Winfrey favorite Lamb (She's Come Undone; I Know This Much Is True) takes a cue from Winfrey herself in collecting and editing this book of writings gleaned from a workshop he conducted for the female inmates of Connecticut's York Correctional Institution. The result is an intriguing and powerful collection of unlikely literary debuts. Although the 11 selections cover the range one might expect from writings plucked from a women's prison-tales of broken homes, poverty, violence, teenage pregnancy, race and gender bias, and, of course, crime and punishment-Lamb succeeds in giving the collection an intense, recognizable emotional core reminiscent of his blockbuster debut novel, She's Come Undone. Indeed, each selection bears the marks of Lamb's heavy involvement-the clipped yet elegant prose and the delicate, occasionally humorous manner in which difficult emotional situations are rendered. Standout selections include Nancy Whiteley's opening remembrance of her troubled adolescence and Diane Bartholomew's artfully rendered, heart-wrenching \"Snapshots of My Early Life.\" As a sad footnote, Bartholomew, whom Lamb credits with inspiring the success of the workshop, will never see her opus in print. Sent to prison in 1990 for murdering her abusive husband, Bartholomew was stricken with cancer while serving her sentence and died in November 2001. In his introduction, Lamb calls the workshop \"a journey rich with laughter, tears, [and] heart-stopping leaps of faith.\" To the credit of Lamb and his authors, this book, the end product of the workshop, is as well. (On sale Feb. 1) Forecast: Although this book is a departure for Lamb, fans of She's Come Undone will undoubtedly enjoy it. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>At the urgent request of the librarian at York Correctional Institution in Connecticut, Lamb (She's Come Undone) organized a writing class for incarcerated women. The intention was to make writing a coping tool that might counter an epidemic of despair at the prison. The 12 pieces in this volume are the best of the students' efforts, and as efforts they are noteworthy, offering memoirs of childhood and acute observations about prison life. In \"Three Steps Past the Monkeys,\" Nancy Birkla chronicles her dependence on drugs by describing her early dependence on candy. In \"Christmas in Prison,\" Robin Cullen describes a congregation at a prison church service as \"a rainbow of skin tones, their chocolate, honey vanilla, and raspberry ripple-colored hair topped with crocheted red scrunchies that sit like cherries atop ice cream parlor hairdos.\" All in all, the volume represents good student writing and a success from everyone's point of view. If it is vying for shelf space with professional writers, it will probably (and justifiably) lose out. But if funds permit, it is worth considering.-Frances Sandiford, formerly with Green Haven Correctional Facility Lib., Stormville, NY Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Intense attestations of lives that ran afoul of the law, from women who have done or are doing time at a prison in Connecticut. Bestselling novelist Lamb (I Know This Much Is True, 1998, etc.) teaches a course in writing at the York Correctional Institution, and he offers here a selection of ten works from the women in his class, plus one by his co-instructor. The pieces are uniformly wrenching, reported from desperate circumstances by authors doomed to punishment. Yet they are as far from self-pity as possible, written by extremely self-aware authors who give a clear sense of setting out to take some degree of control of their destinies. Each piece is a probing re-examination of its author’s life and of the reasons she ended up in prison. Some recount childhoods taxing by any yardstick, years of learning to become \"experts at detecting the slightest barometric fluctuations of Storm Mom,\" or of being raped by a father who’d just lost the house in a card game—and, at term, having the baby spirited away before its mother was allowed to touch him. There are demons aplenty, inner ones begging to be tamed by drugs, and outer ones, like husbands, uncontrollable (one woman asks, \"Why do I feel safer here in prison than I felt at home?\"). The maximum-security prison is a tough house, and prospects of release for some of the writers are dim: \"Ineligible for parole, I have served the first nine years of my twenty-five year sentence. I am 27.\" This same person will also say, \"I’m kept afloat by my writing.\" And her writing, like other of the women’s, is lean, with the momentum and clarity needed for its work of helping frame and make sense of these authors’ situations. There are things, says Lamb,that need \"to be known about prison and prisoners. There are misconceptions to be abandoned, biases to be dropped.\" Here’s a step in that direction.\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<p class=\"null1\">FOREWORD</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">by David Lehman</p>\n<p>Over the years I’ve read novels centering on lawyers, doctors, diplomats, teachers, financiers, even car salesmen and dentists, but not until 2009 did I come across one about the travails of the editor of a poetry anthology. When word of <i>The Anthologist</i>, Nicholson Baker’s new novel, reached me last September, I couldn’t wait to read it. Baker’s novels defy convention and reveal an obsessive nature, and I wondered what he would make of American poetry, for surely his novel would reflect a strenuous engagement with the art. The title character here, Paul Chowder by unfortunate name, has put together an anthology of poems he is calling <i>Only Rhyme.</i> The phrase describes the notional book’s contents and indicates the editor’s conception of poetic virtue. Paul has chosen the contents of his anthology but is now, on the eve of a deadline, afflicted with writer’s block. He needs to write a foreword but cannot. “How many people read introductions to poetry anthologies, anyway?” he wonders, then volunteers, “I do, but I’m not normal.”</p>\n<p>Having asked myself that same question and given a similar answer, I can appreciate the speaker’s troubling awareness of the many poets who have to be left out of his book—and the relatively few people who will bother to read his introductory essay. The task of writing a prefatory note becomes no less difficult when it is an annual requirement, though Nicholson Baker may have made my job a little easier this time around. Every editor has the impulse to use the introductory space to open the door, welcome the guest, and disappear without further ado. But some things are worth saying, and one such is Baker’s defense of anthologies. For a poet facing all the perils that lurk in a poet’s path—a poet very like the novel’s Paul Chowder—anthologies represent the possibility of a belated second chance. And it is that possibility, however slim, that spurs the poet to stick to a vocation that offers so much resistance and promises so few rewards. The “you” in these sentences refers to the American poet—and perhaps to American poetry itself, an oddity in an age that worships celebrity. “You think: One more poem. You think: There will be some as yet ungathered anthology of American poetry. It will be the anthology that people tote around with them on subways thirty-five, forty years from now.” The poet’s conception of fame exists within modest limits, but it is persistent: “And you think: Maybe the very poem I write today will somehow pry open a space in that future anthology and maybe it will drop into position and root itself there.”</p>\n<p>Baker’s skeptical distance from the fray makes his take on things particularly compelling. The opinions he puts forth are provocative and entertaining. A proponent of the sit-com as the great American art form, Baker’s anthologist believes that “any random episode of <i>Friends</i> is probably better, more uplifting for the human spirit, than ninety-nine percent of the poetry or drama or fiction or history ever published.” That is quite a statement, even allowing for the complexity of irony. (After all, to be “uplifting for the human spirit” may not be the ideal criterion by which to judge poetry or history.) The speaker establishes his credentials as an American poet with his realism for self-pity’s sake. He suspects that poets form a “community” only in the realm of piety: “We all love the busy ferment, and we all know it’s nonsense. Getting together for conferences of international poetry. Hah! A joke. Reading our poems. Our little moment. Physical presence. In the same room with. A community. Forget it. It’s a joke.”</p>\n<p>Baker (or his mouthpiece) likes Swinburne, Poe, Millay, Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, and the contemporary British poets Wendy Cope and James Fenton. He disapproves of free verse, distrusts the “ultra-extreme enjambment” that you find in William Carlos Williams or Charles Olson, and argues that “iambic pentameter” is something of a hoax. As for the unrhymed poems that dominate literary magazines and university workshops, he feels it would be more accurate to call them “plums” and their authors “plummets” or “plummers.” How did we get to this state of affairs? In Baker’s account, the chief villain is Ezra Pound, “a blustering bigot—a humorless jokester—a talentless pasticheur—a confidence man.” Pound advocated modernism in verse with the same bullying arrogance that went into his radio broadcasts on behalf of Mussolini, and that is no accident, because the impulse that led to fascism also gave rise to modern poetry. Modernism as Pound preached it and T. S. Eliot practiced it—in <i>The Waste Land</i>, “a hodge-podge of flummery and borrowed paste”—was, in short, probably as ruinous for the art of verse as fascism was for Europe. The popularity of translations, especially prose versions of exotic foreign verse rendered from a language that the translator doesn’t know, also did its part to hasten the “death of rhyme.”</p>\n<p>The views articulated in <i>The Anthologist</i> are antithetical to contemporary practice in ways that recall Philip Larkin’s conviction that Pound ruined poetry, Picasso ruined painting, and Charlie Parker ruined jazz: the dissenting position, pushed to an amusing extreme, and stated with uncompromising intelligence. The narrator can sound a sour note. To teach creative writing to college students is to be “a professional teller of lies,” he maintains, gleefully quoting Elizabeth Bishop on the subject: “I think one of the worst things I know about modern education is this ‘Creative Writing’ business.” Nevertheless Baker’s opinions are worth pondering, especially when the “difficulty versus accessibility” question becomes the subject of debate. And his advice to the aspiring poet is astute. Don’t postpone writing the poem, he says. “Put it down, work on it, finish it. If you don’t get on it now, somebody else will do something similar, and when you crack open next year’s <i>Best American Poetry</i> and see it under somebody else’s name you’ll hate yourself.”</p>\n<p><i>The Anthologist</i> was well received and prominently reviewed in book supplements that rarely notice poetry books, let alone anthologies of them, except with a certain contempt, which was a mild irony but an old story. Some laudatory articles went so far as to declare that “you” will enjoy the work “even if you generally couldn’t care less about verse.” But then, when poetry or the teaching of poetry is discussed, commentators have a hard time avoiding a note of condescension. Poetry is called a “lost art.” It is thought to be something young people go through, a phase; something you have to apologize for, as when a poet at a reading reassures the audience that only three more poems remain on the docket. And yet poetry retains its prestige. The term exists as a sort of benchmark in fields ranging from politics to athletics. Columnists enjoy reminding newly elected officials that “you campaign in poetry but govern in prose”—an axiom that aligns poetry on the side of idealism and eloquence against the bureaucratic details and inconveniences of prosaic administration. In the <i>Financial Times</i>, the Czech photographer Miroslav Tichý, who spied on women with his homemade viewfinder, “stealing their likenesses as they giggled, gossiped and dreamed,” is described as “a peeping Tom with a poet’s eye.” Of Nancy Pelosi, readers of <i>Time</i> learned that, to the Speaker’s credit, when a colleague’s mother dies, she “encloses a poem written by her own mother with her condolence.” In the same issue of the magazine, a flattering profile of General Stanley McChrystal, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, appeared. During the Iraq war, McChrystal sent copies of “The Second Coming” to his special operators, challenging them to flip the meaning of Yeats’s lines: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.”</p>\n<p>Has there ever been a really good movie about a poet as opposed to the many excellent movies in which poetry is quoted to smart effect? <i>Bright Star</i>, Jane Campion’s film about the ill-starred romance of John Keats and the barely legal Fanny Brawne, came out in 2009 and showed there is life left in the familiar stereotype of the consumptive poet burning a fever for love. Campion won over Quentin Tarantino. “The movie made me think about taking a writing class,” the director of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> said. “One of the best things that can happen from a movie about an author is that you actually want to read their work.” On television, poetry continues to put in regular appearances on <i>The PBS NewsHour</i> with Jim Lehrer and sometimes sneaks into scripted shows. When an advertising copywriter on <i>Mad Men</i> loses his job, he doesn’t take it well. He “did not go gentle into that good night,” an ex-associate observes. The critic Stephen Burt believes that <i>Project Runway</i> holds some useful lessons for poetry critics: “<i>Project Runway</i> even recalls the famous exercises in ‘practical criticism’ performed at the University of Cambridge in the 1920s, in which professor I. A. Richards asked his students to make snap judgments about unfamiliar poems.” I have commented on the inspired way that quotations from poems turn up in classic Hollywood movies, and if you’re lucky enough to catch <i>It’s Always Fair Weather</i> the next time Robert Osborne shows it on TCM, you’ll see a superb 1950s movie musical (music by André Previn, book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green) that sums itself up brilliantly in three lines from <i>As You Like It</i> that enliven a conversation between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse:</p>\n<p>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.</p>\n<p>Then heigh-ho, the holly!</p>\n<p>This life is most jolly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can’t pull the wool over the creative writers responsible for <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent.</i> In a 2009 episode, a celebrated campus bard is murdered by his ex-girlfriend, who is handy with a knife. Has he been pimping out his attractive young assistants to wealthy donors? After learning how rotten the poets are to one another, the major case squad detective says that if her daughter ever says she wants to be a poet, she’d tell her to join the Mafia instead: “Nicer people.” As convalescents confined to hospital beds know, you can go wall to wall with reruns of <i>Law and Order</i>, and sure enough, the day after this episode aired I saw a rerun of <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</i>, in which the villain is a nerdy insurance man, an actuary with Asperger’s syndrome, whose name is Wallace Stevens. The detectives call him Wally affectionately. I spent the rest of my bedridden day with Stevens’s collected poems.</p>\n<p><i>Haaretz</i>, Israel’s oldest Hebrew-language daily, turned over its pages entirely to poets and novelists for one day in June 2009. The results were unsurprising in some ways (a lot of first-person point of view) but inventive and unconventional in the coverage of the stock market (“everything okay”) and the weather (a sonnet likening summer to an unsharpened pencil). The experiment reminded me of W. S. Di Piero’s assertion that the writing of good prose is the acid test of a poet’s intelligence. “Some shy from putting prose out there because it’s a giveaway,” Di Piero has written. “You can’t fake it. It reveals quality of mind, for better or worse, in a culture where poems can be faked. Find a faker and ask him or her to write anything more substantial than a jacket blurb, and the jig is up.” When we posted Di Piero’s remark on the <i>Best American Poetry</i> blog, Sally Ashton added an apt simile (a poem can be faked “like an orgasm”) and a few inevitable questions (“Who is fooled? Who benefits?”). Speaking of the <i>BAP</i> blog, there are days when it resembles nothing so much as a cross-cultural newspaper written by poets and poetry lovers. Recent visitors to the <i>BAP</i> blog could read Catharine Stimpson’s reaction to homicidal violence at the University of Alabama; Lewis Saul’s meticulously annotated commentary on thirty films by Akira Kurosawa; Jennifer Michael Hecht’s heartfelt plea to poets contemplating the suicide of Rachel Wetzsteon (“don’t kill yourself”); Laura Orem’s obituaries for Lucille Clifton, Jean Simmons, and J. D. Salinger; Katha Pollitt on Berlin in the fall; Larry Epstein on Bob Dylan; Ken Tucker on new books of poetry; Todd Swift on young British poets; Phoebe Putnam on the covers poets choose for their books; Mitch Sisskind’s “poetic tips of the day” (e.g., “Secrecy sustains the world”); Gabrielle Calvocoressi at the sports desk; Terence Winch on Irish American music; Stacey Harwood on <i>nocino</i>, the Italian liqueur made from under-ripe green walnuts; and a James Cummins epigram entitled “Anti-Confessional”: “What it was like, I don’t recall, or care to; / believe me, you should be grateful I spare you.”</p>\n<p><i>The Best American Poetry</i> anthology itself, now in its twenty-third year, remains committed to the idea that American poetry is as vital as it is various and that it is possible to capture the spirit of its diversity and a measure of its excellence in an annual survey of our magazines, in print or online. As the selections are made by a different editor each year, each a distinguished practitioner, the series has inevitably become an annotated chronicle of the taste of our leading poets. I persuaded Amy Gerstler to make the selections for the 2010 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> because of my delight in her poems and my respect for her judgment, and it was wonderful to work with her. Amy’s new book, <i>Dearest Creature</i>, came out last year, and augmented her reputation as arguably the most inventive and ambitious poet of her generation. Gerstler can be very funny without forfeiting her right to be taken seriously; she has a quality of sincerity, of truth-telling, that can coexist with the most sophisticated of comic sensibilities. Her poems of deep feeling may take on an insouciant disguise: a letter to a cherished niece about the virtues of an encyclopedia, a conversation between a black taffeta and strapless pink dress, a riff consisting entirely of slang phrases from the not too distant past. Yet always at the heart of the poetry is an insight into the human condition and the ability to state it simply and powerfully: “Some of us grow up doing / credible impressions of model citizens / (though sooner or later hairline / cracks appear in our facades). The rest / get dubbed eccentrics, unnerved and undone / by other people’s company, for which we / nevertheless pine.” David Kirby reviewed <i>Dearest Creature</i> in <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i> “Gerstler is skilled in every kind of comedy, from slapstick to whimsy,” Kirby wrote. “Yet there’s a deep seriousness in every one of these poems, like the plaintive ‘Midlife Lullaby,’ in which the cow who is now the meatloaf in somebody’s sandwich speaks of life’s passing pleasures as hauntingly as one of those skeletons who tend to pop up in medieval allegories to remind young knights of their mortality.” Kirby concluded his review with a ringing endorsement: “In Amy Gerstler I trust.”</p>\n<p>The world has been slow to react to the case of Saw Wai, the imprisoned Burmese poet who was arrested two years ago for publishing a love poem for Valentine’s Day with a secret message critical of Burma’s military dictator, Than Shwe. But the story refuses to die, and the anonymously translated poem itself has now been published (in <i>Pen America</i>) and reprinted (in <i>Harper’s</i>, in February 2010). What early journalistic accounts called a “straightforward” or “innocuous” love poem turns out to be something much richer and stranger. Entitled “February 14,” Saw Wai’s poem, which appeared in the Rangoon magazine <i>The Love Journal</i>, was initially said to have been a torch song to the fashion model who rejected the poet but taught him the meaning of love. Nothing of the sort. It exemplifies rather a particular strain of modernist poetry, the leading-edge poems of the 1930s that were aped (and perfected) by the Australian hoax poet Ern Malley. The poem is an acrostic—that is, the first letters of the lines, when read down vertically, spell out a message, and in this case that message is, “General Than Shwe is power crazy.” In Burmese, Than means “million” and Shwe means “gold,” so when Saw Wai concludes his poem with the injunction “Millions of people / Who know how to love / Please clap your gilded hands / And laugh out loud,” he is secretly urging his compatriots to laugh the “power crazy” head of the junta off the stage. It took courage to write these lines. It also took an extraordinary talent for modern poetry considered as a kind of cipher, and the result in its English translation might be read as either a brief for the methods of modernism or a textbook illustration of what Nicholson Baker would have us see as the tempting dangers of the non-rhyming, prose-saturated “plum”:</p>\n<p>Arensberg said:<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Only once you have experienced deep pain</p>\n<p>And madness</p>\n<p>And like an adolescent</p>\n<p>Thought the blurred photo of a model</p>\n<p>Great art</p>\n<p>Can you call it heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Millions of people</p>\n<p>Who know how to love</p>\n<p>Please clap your gilded hands</p>\n<p>And laugh out loud.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>. Walter Conrad Arensberg, the noted art collector and donor of great paintings to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, wrote <i>The Cryptography of Shakespeare</i> (1922), purporting to find, in the Bard’s plays, anagrams and acrostics that prove Francis Bacon’s authorship. Arensberg wrote symbolist-influenced poetry, but it is conceivable that spurious cryptography is his real contribution to the radical element in modern poetry.</p>\n<p>© 2010 David Lehman</p>",

Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience.<br>\n From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, “into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we’ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.” Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.</p>",
    "excerpt": "Foreword<br>\nThe Essay in the Twentieth Century<br>\nWhen I was very young, my father purchased a small, uniform set of <br>\ncheap literary classics. Why, I never knew. He was not a reader. <br>\nPerhaps he had been duped by a door-to-door salesman. Perhaps he had <br>\naspirations for his children. The books crowded the only bookshelf in <br>\na cramped two-family house hedged in by humming factories on a narrow <br>\nstreet that dead-ended into the mysterious and spectacular sumac-<br>\nlined banks of the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. As a result <br>\nof his once-in-a-lifetime purchase I grew up with the privilege of <br>\nknowing that Emerson was not merely the name of a television set.<br>\n<br>\nI found Emerson's message bracing and liberating. I can see <br>\nit now as self-help elevated to the highest literary standard, but <br>\nreading \"Self-Reliance\" as an adolescent I simply took heart from his <br>\nexhortations to resist conformity, trust in oneself, and not feel <br>\npressured by conventions, parties, and authority: \"I am ashamed to <br>\nthink how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large <br>\nsocieties and dead institutions,\" he said. \"If I know your sect, I <br>\nanticipate your argument,\" he said. \"Insist on yourself; never <br>\nimitate,\" he said. He warned about the physical pain of forced smiles <br>\nand acknowledged the advantages of being misunderstood. If the <br>\nwritings of the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides comprised a <br>\nGuide for the Perplexed, Emerson's essays provided a Guide for the <br>\nIntimidated. His independent, freethinking, inquisitive mind shaped <br>\nAmerican thought and writing, and his spiritual heirsinvented the <br>\ntwentieth-century essay.<br>\nAlthough Emerson may be said to hover over the volume, his <br>\npresence can be detected more directly in one of his most prominent <br>\ndescendants, William James. Although this selection of great American <br>\nessays begins in 1901, one could argue that the symbolic origins of <br>\nthe twentieth-century essay go back to the day in 1842 when Emerson <br>\nwas invited by the James family to visit their New York apartment <br>\nand \"bless\" young William in his cradle. As a teacher, lecturer, <br>\nphysician, scientist, and one of the founders of modern psychology, <br>\nWilliam James would exert a powerful influence over the new century. <br>\nTwo of his students, W.E.B. Du Bois and Gertrude Stein, would <br>\npermanently alter the course of the American essay by initiating two <br>\nnew modes of literary introspection: Du Bois's \"double-consciousness\" <br>\ngrounded in racial identity and Stein's experiments with \"stream of <br>\nconsciousness.\" Both originated in the critical first decade of the <br>\ncentury, and their literary legacies can be felt throughout this <br>\ncollection.<br>\nThe twentieth-century essay also emerged from a resistance to <br>\nthe \"familiar\" or \"polite\" essay that had been a literary staple of <br>\nthe preceding era. Proper, congenial, Anglophilic, the genteel essay <br>\nsurvived, even against the skepticism and irascibility of the Mark <br>\nTwains, Randolph Bournes, and H. L. Menckens, who did their best to <br>\nbury it. By the 1930s, however, some writers were lamenting its <br>\ndemise, and in the most curious metaphors. \"The familiar essay, that <br>\nlavender-scented little old lady of literature, has passed away,\" one <br>\nwrote, regretting that magazines now filled their pages with \"crisp <br>\narticles, blatant exposés, or statistic-laden surveys,\" and <br>\nconcluding that one day \"her pale ghost will not appear at all, and <br>\nthe hard young sociologists can have her pages all to themselves.\" <br>\nBut the \"pale ghost\" did not vanish all at once. It lived on in <br>\ncollege courses and gave the essay a bad name for decades. The goal <br>\nof English teachers, the novelist Kurt Vonnegut recalls, was to get <br>\nyou \"to write like cultivated Englishmen of a century or more ago.\"<br>\nThis collection features none of those \"lavender-scented\" <br>\nessays, not even for historical reasons. Our object was not to <br>\nconstruct a Museum of the American Essay. Although some vestiges <br>\nof \"gentility\" or essayistic \"leisure\" may have seeped in here and <br>\nthere, the ruling idea behind the volume was that the essays should <br>\nspeak to the present, not merely represent the past. So you will find <br>\nmore \"hard young sociologists\" here than \"cultivated\" literati. After <br>\nall, some of those young social scientists were Jane Addams, Zora <br>\nNeale Hurston, and a youthful Saul Bellow, who happened to be <br>\nstudying sociology and anthropology at Northwestern at precisely the <br>\nsame time the genteel essayists were lamenting their own demise. The <br>\nsociologists, accompanied by such self-taught social critics as <br>\nEdmund Wilson, Richard Wright, and James Agee, brought the essay out <br>\nof the library and into the American factories, city streets, <br>\ncourthouses, and tenant farms. For many of them, ardent pacifists and <br>\nreformers, writing essays would amount to what James called \"the <br>\nmoral equivalent of war.\"<br>\nUnlike their predecessors, twentieth-century essayists were <br>\neager to confront inner as well as outer strife. To be sure, the <br>\ngenteel essay was personal, but no matter how \"familiar,\" it always <br>\npolitely stopped short of full disclosure. Here, too, William James <br>\nmade his presence felt. The brilliant chapters \"The Divided Self\" <br>\nand \"The Sick Soul\" in his monumental The Varieties of Religious <br>\nExperience (1902) would become a valuable resource for essayists <br>\nseeking ways to articulate despair, breakdowns, aberrant states of <br>\nconsciousness, psychic confusion, the ineffable in general. F. Scott <br>\nFitzgerald's famous observation in \"The Crack-Up\" - \"The test of a <br>\nfirst-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in <br>\nthe mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function\" -<br>\n laid out a course for future essayists and expanded the <br>\npossibilities of self-disclosure. As writers began amplifying the <br>\npersonal essay into what is now known singularly as \"the memoir,\" the <br>\nprocesses of confession would know no limits.<br>\nWhat next? Will this new century reject our \"best\" essays as <br>\ndramatically as the twentieth discarded those of James Russell Lowell <br>\nand Oliver Wendell Holmes? The 1890s, too, saw astonishing changes in <br>\ntechnology, rapid changes that frightened Henry Adams as he wondered <br>\nwhat the \"Law of Acceleration\" would finally lead to. We have reached <br>\nhis speculative end point - visionary though he was, he never <br>\nimagined a world transformed by electronics. The Internet is already <br>\ngenerating new sources of essays. Will it somehow channel the usual <br>\nprocesses of prose into new literary forms the way some thought the <br>\ntypewriter had once done? Will young essayists discover audiences <br>\nwithout having to sweat through the hundreds of rejection slips James <br>\nThurber received before he could break into print? And will they do <br>\nwhat few from any century have ever done: make a living writing <br>\nessays? These remain to be seen, but what I think we can say for <br>\ncertain is that whatever new forms the essay takes, if they are <br>\nwonderful, they will have the blessing of William James and his <br>\nlegitimate heirs.<br>\n<br>\nAbout This Collection<br>\nThis volume is not a \"best of the best.\" I founded The Best American <br>\nEssays series in 1986, and therefore Joyce Carol Oates and I had only <br>\na small slice of the century to provide us with essays that had <br>\nalready achieved an annual \"best\" status. Only seven of the essays in <br>\nthis volume come from the series. We wish we could have included many <br>\nmore of the superb contemporary writers who have contributed to the <br>\nyearly books, but it was of course not possible. Our consolation is <br>\nthat their work is still accessible to readers and that the annual <br>\nbooks are for the most part available in libraries and bookstores. It <br>\nwas important that we include writers from previous generations who <br>\nmay not be well known to today's readers and who in our opinion still <br>\nvery much deserve an audience.<br>\nI proceeded with this book in much the same way that I have <br>\nwith the annual volumes. I screened a good number of essays - though <br>\nfar, far more than usual - and turned them over to Joyce Carol Oates <br>\nfor a final decision. There were hundreds of essays to consider and <br>\nso little space. But we winnowed and winnowed and arrived at these <br>\nfifty-five. We tried to include the best of as many different kinds <br>\nof essay as possible - personal, critical, philosophical, humorous, <br>\npastoral, autobiographical, scientific, documentary, political. <br>\nObviously we had to pull back in many cases. A comparable volume <br>\ncould be assembled to showcase each one of these categories. I also <br>\nexercised one final choice: I insisted that Oates's essay from The <br>\nBest American Essays 1996, \"They All Just Went Away,\" be included.<br>\n \"Essays end up in books,\" Susan Sontag writes, \"but they <br>\nstart their lives in magazines.\" That fact may not interest many <br>\nreaders, but it played a large role in the research for this book, <br>\nsince between an essay's debut in a periodical and its inclusion in a <br>\ncollection, a good deal of revision often occurs. Vladimir Nabokov's <br>\nmemoir of his father, for example, went through three very distinct <br>\npublishing stages. It began life as \"The Perfect Past\" in The New <br>\nYorker in 1950, but Nabokov, dissatisfied with some of the editing, <br>\nreturned to his original typescript when he included (and expanded) <br>\nit as the opening chapter of his 1951 autobiography, Conclusive <br>\nEvidence. When he revised that book as Speak, Memory: An <br>\nAutobiography Revisited in 1966, he expanded the essay yet again. Of <br>\nthe three published versions, we chose - as we did with many of the <br>\nselections - to reprint the final version, as it would reflect and <br>\nrespect the author's final decisions. But in some instances <br>\n(consistency \"is the hobgoblin of little minds,\" Emerson said), we <br>\nselected the first or a different published version.<br>\nSome essays start out looking like essays only to reemerge in <br>\nunexpected contexts. James Agee's lovely childhood <br>\nreminiscence, \"Knoxville: Summer of 1915,\" started out in Partisan <br>\nReview in 1938 but was given a new twist when an editor cleverly <br>\nborrowed and italicized it in 1957 to serve as the introduction to <br>\nAgee's posthumously published novel, A Death in the Family. Other <br>\nessays in this book were also put to service by their authors to <br>\nintroduce works of fiction: Richard Wright's \"The Ethics of Living <br>\nJim Crow\" became the preface to his collection of stories Uncle Tom's <br>\nChildren, and N. Scott Momaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain\" now <br>\nserves as the prologue to his popular novel of the same title.<br>\nI discovered that there is rarely only one version of an <br>\nessay. Susan Sontag's useful observation sometimes gets reversed: an <br>\nessay starts out in book form and ends up in a magazine. Several <br>\nessays in this volume were skillfully carved out of books and re-<br>\ncreated either by their authors or a magazine's editors as <br>\nindependent essays. Usually, what's required is the removal of the <br>\ninterstitial glue that connects a book's separate chapters. For <br>\nexample, the opening sections of Maya Angelou's 1970 memoir, I Know <br>\nWhy the Caged Bird Sings, were transformed into a memorable childhood <br>\nreminiscence of the same title in Harper's Magazine.<br>\nBecause essays may go through so many publishing variations, <br>\nsettling on a precise date for each selection was no easy matter. I <br>\nproceeded largely case by case. Nabokov's 1966 essay on his father <br>\nwas so transformed from its 1950 origins that it seemed only <br>\nreasonable to use the later date. So, too, I decided to use the final <br>\npublication date for John Muir's Alaskan adventures with his <br>\nunforgettable companion Stickeen; it was that version, and not the <br>\nearlier and now forgotten essay, that became his most popular work. <br>\nBut occasionally I thought it would be misleading to use the final <br>\ndate of publication. Langston Hughes's \"Bop,\" for example, clearly <br>\ncomes out of the forties; though it was revised considerably for <br>\nsubsequent book publication, to place it in a later decade would <br>\ndistort its contemporary flavor. An essay like Mark Twain's \"Corn-<br>\npone Opinions,\" never published in the author's lifetime, is listed <br>\nby date of composition.<br>\nFor the reader's convenience, I have attached brief notes to <br>\neach essay outlining its publishing history and supplying relevant <br>\ncontextual information. I have placed an asterisk before the source <br>\nused for this collection. I have also translated foreign words and <br>\nphrases within brackets when it seemed necessary. Additional <br>\ninformation is contained in the Biographical Notes in the back of the <br>\nbook, where I included pertinent information on the writer's career, <br>\nrelevant details to establish a context for the selected essay, and <br>\ntitles of books and collections (with the emphasis on nonfiction) <br>\nthat will direct interested readers to more books by that writer.<br>\nWriters and magazine editors interested in submitting <br>\npublished essays for the annual volumes should send complimentary <br>\nissues, subscriptions, or appropriate material to Robert Atwan, <br>\nSeries Editor, The Best American Essays, Box 220, Readville, <br>\nMassachusetts 02137-9998. Criteria and guidelines can be found in the <br>\nannual book.<br>\nAcknowledgments<br>\nAs I researched books and periodicals for this unprecedented volume, <br>\nI often felt like Henry Adams, poised at the crossroads of two time <br>\nperiods: the rapidly accelerating age of cyberspace that instantly <br>\nfurnishes vast amounts of information and the old-fashioned era of <br>\ndim library stacks and dusty, out-of-print books. The experience was <br>\nboth high-tech and low-tech. If it was satisfying to sit at my desk <br>\nand click a few keys for immediate access to material that only a few <br>\nyears ago would have required frequent library visits, it was even <br>\nmore satisfying to hold in my hand hardcover first editions of books <br>\nlike Martin Luther King's Why We Can't Wait or H. L. Mencken's <br>\nPrejudices. Even obtaining these books involved travel in both <br>\nworlds: through the Internet I could enter my local library's <br>\nregional network, discover books it didn't own, and conveniently <br>\norder them online. A day or two later - and sometimes within hours - <br>\nI would be experiencing the tactile and intellectual pleasures of <br>\nhandling some of the treasured pieces of our literary heritage. For <br>\ntheir invaluable assistance, then, I want to thank especially the <br>\nstaff of the Milton Public Library as well as all the other <br>\ninstitutions connected with the Old Colony Library Network in <br>\nMassachusetts.<br>\nWhat I was unable to find, my researcher could. Much of the <br>\nknottier research - establishing the original source or date of an <br>\nessay, or tracking down an elusive periodical - was performed by <br>\nDonna Ashley, who relied on the superb resources of the libraries at <br>\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Boston <br>\nCollege, and the Boston Public Library. Nearly all of the source <br>\nnotes attached to each essay derive from her dogged research; without <br>\nher assistance this project might have taken another year to <br>\ncomplete. I want to thank, too, Arthur Johnson for his generous help <br>\nin providing permissions data for all of the essays. I borrowed a <br>\ngood deal of biographical information about the essayists from some <br>\nof my previous anthologies and would like to thank a few coeditors <br>\nfor their contributions: Martha Banta, Bruce Forer, Justin Kaplan, <br>\nDonald McQuade, David Minter, Jon Roberts, Robert Stepto, and William <br>\nVesterman. I'm enormously grateful to Charles H. Christensen for his <br>\nadvice and encouragement over the years. The Houghton Mifflin staff <br>\nhas been helpful and supportive as always, and I'd like to thank <br>\nJanet Silver, Sean Lawler, Larry Cooper, Bridget Marmion, Dean <br>\nJohnson, and Bruce Cantley for all their efforts. My wife, Hélène <br>\nAtwan, kindly read over portions of the manuscript and offered many <br>\nvaluable suggestions for which I am very grateful. Finally, it was a <br>\ngreat pleasure to work once again with Joyce Carol Oates. Her broad <br>\nknowledge of American writing and her literary judgment transformed <br>\nwhat seemed like a paralyzing critical task - reducing several <br>\nhundred great essays to a mere fifty-five - into a spirited, <br>\nilluminating assessment of the modern American essayist's struggle to <br>\nencompass the creative energies and social emergencies of a century <br>\nthat had no shortage of either.<br>\nRobert Atwan <br>\n<br>\nIntroduction<br>\nThe Art of the (American) Essay<br>\nHere is a history of America told in many voices.<br>\nIt's an elliptical tale, or a compendium of tales, of the <br>\nAmerican twentieth century by way of individual essays that, fitting <br>\ntogether into a kind of mobile mosaic, suggest where we've come from, <br>\nand who we are, and where we are going. In his probing, <br>\nprovocative \"The Creation Myth of Cooperstown,\" Stephen Jay Gould <br>\nasks: \"Why do we prefer creation myths to evolutionary stories?\" The <br>\nmore we know of history, of both the natural and the civilized <br>\nworlds, the more we understand that our tangled lives are ever <br>\nevolving, and that our culture, far from being timeless, is a living <br>\nexpression of Time.<br>\nThe essay, in its directness and intimacy, in its first-<br>\nperson authority, is the ideal literary form to convey such a vision. <br>\nBy tradition essays have been categorized as formal or informal; yet <br>\nit can be argued that all essays are an expression of the human voice <br>\naddressing an imagined audience, seeking to shift opinion, to <br>\ninfluence judgment, to appeal to another in his or her common <br>\nhumanity. Even the most artfully composed essay suggests a <br>\nnaturalness of discourse. As our precursor Montaigne advised, \"We <br>\nmust remove the mask.\"<br>\nThe essays in this volume have all been written by writers <br>\nwho have published at least one collection of essays or nonfiction. <br>\nNot only did this principle allow the editors a reasonable means of <br>\nlimiting selections, it is an acknowledgment that writing is a <br>\nvocation, not merely an avocation. In a historical overview of a <br>\ncentury virtually teeming with talent, I wanted to honor those <br>\nwriters who have made writing their life's work. I didn't see my role <br>\nas one to reward the lucky amateur who writes a single good essay, <br>\nthen disappears forever. Better to search for little-known but <br>\nexcellent essays by, for instance, writers of historical significance <br>\nlike John Jay Chapman, Jane Addams, Edmund Wilson. Most of the essays <br>\nare \"informal\"; but this isn't to suggest that they are innocent, <br>\nunmediated utterances lacking the stratagems of art. Even Mark <br>\nTwain's \"Corn-pone Opinions,\" delivered in the author's <br>\ncharacteristic forthright voice, is driven by a passionate <br>\nintellectual conviction regarding the gullibility of mankind and the <br>\ntragic consequences of this gullibility.<br>\nMy general theme in the assemblage of this volume has been a <br>\nsearch for the expression of personal experience within the <br>\nhistorical, the individual talent within the tradition (to paraphrase <br>\nT. S. Eliot). My preference was always to essays that, springing from <br>\nintense personal experience, are nonetheless significantly linked to <br>\nlarger issues, even if, as in the case of James Thurber and S. J. <br>\nPerelman, these issues are viewed playfully. The emotion I felt when <br>\nbeginning to read most of the essays gathered here was one of great <br>\nexcitement and anticipation; even, at times, a distinct visceral <br>\nthrill. As an editor, I am primarily a reader. I could not <br>\ncountenance including essays out of duty's sake that, in fact, I <br>\nfound deadly dull. For the many essays considered for this volume, <br>\nthe majority of which ultimately had to be excluded, I was the ideal <br>\nreader: I wanted to like what I read, and I was committed to reading <br>\nthe entire essay with sympathy. If you will substitute \"literature\" <br>\nfor \"poetry\" in this famous remark in a letter of Emily Dickinson's, <br>\nyou have my basic criterion for the work included in The Best <br>\nAmerican Essays of the Century: \"If I read a book [and] it makes my <br>\nwhole body so cold no fire can ever warm me I know that is poetry. If <br>\nI feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know <br>\nthat is poetry.\"<br>\nAnd what powerful openings in certain of these exemplary <br>\nessays:<br>\nWe are met to commemorate the anniversary of one of the most terrible <br>\ncrimes in history - not for the purpose of condemning it, but to <br>\nrepent of our share in it.<br>\n- John Jay Chapman, \"Coatesville\" (1912)<br>\nThe knowledge of the existence of Devil Baby burst upon the residents <br>\nof Hull House one day when three Italian women, with an excited rush <br>\nthrough the door, demanded that he be shown to them.<br>\n- Jane Addams, \"The Devil Baby at Hull-House\" (1916)<br>\nOf course all life is a process of breaking down, but the blows that <br>\ndo the dramatic side of the work - the big sudden blows that come, or <br>\nseem to come, from outside - the ones you remember and blame things <br>\non and, in moments of weakness, tell your friends about, don't show <br>\ntheir effect all at once. There is another sort of blow that comes <br>\nfrom within - that you don't feel until it's too late to do anything <br>\nabout it, until you realize with finality that in some regard you <br>\nwill never be as good a man again.<br>\n- F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"The Crack-Up\" (1936)<br>\nThe cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our <br>\nexistence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of <br>\ndarkness.<br>\n- Vladimir Nabokov, \"Perfect Past\" (1950)<br>\nOn the twenty-ninth of July, in 1943, my father died. On the same <br>\nday, a few hours later, his last child was born. Over a month before <br>\nthis, while all our energies were concentrated in waiting for these <br>\nevents, there had been, in Detroit, one of the bloodiest race riots <br>\nof the century.<br>\n- James Baldwin, \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955)<br>\nThe decaying, downtown shopping section of Memphis - still another <br>\nMain Street - lay, the weekend before Martin Luther King's funeral, <br>\nunder a siege.<br>\n- Elizabeth Hardwick, \"The Apotheosis of Martin Luther King\" (1968)<br>\nWe were all strapped into the seats of the Chinook, fifty of us, and <br>\nsomething, someone was hitting it from the outside with an enormous <br>\nhammer. How do they do that? I thought, we're a thousand feet in the <br>\nair!<br>\n- Michael Herr, \"Illumination Rounds\" (1977)<br>\nWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.<br>\n- Joan Didion, \"The White Album\" (1978)<br>\nOf course there are crucial distinctions between the art of <br>\nthe essay and the art of prose fiction, yet to the reader the <br>\nimmediate experience in reading is an engagement with that mysterious <br>\npresence we call voice. Reading, we \"hear\" another's speech <br>\nreplicated in our heads as if by magic. Where in life we sometimes <br>\n(allegedly infrequently) fall in love at first sight, in reading we <br>\nmay fall in love with the special, singular qualities of another's <br>\nvoice; we may become mesmerized, haunted; we may be provoked, <br>\nshocked, illuminated; we may be galvanized into action; we may be <br>\nenraged, revulsed, and yet! - drawn irresistibly to experience this <br>\nvoice again, and again. It's a writer's unique employment of language <br>\nto which we, as readers, are drawn, though we assume we admire the <br>\nwriter primarily for what he or she \"has to say.\" For consider: how <br>\nmany intelligent, earnest, right-minded commentators published essays <br>\non such important subjects as racial conflict in twentieth-century <br>\nAmerica, social and personal disintegration in the thirties, <br>\nmorality, democracy, nostalgia-for-a-vanishing-America; class <br>\nstruggle, civil rights, Martin Luther King, Jr., the Vietnam War, the <br>\nmystical experience of nature, ethnic diversity, various <br>\nAmerican \"myths\" - and how few of these are worth rereading, let <br>\nalone enshrining, in this new century. To be an editor in so massive <br>\nan undertaking, committed to reading with sympathy countless essays <br>\nof high worth and distinction published in the most prestigious <br>\njournals of their era, beginning in about 1900 and sweeping through <br>\nthe decades, is to experience first-hand that quickening of dread, <br>\nwhich Nabokov calls mere \"common sense,\" in the realization of human <br>\nmortality. So many meritorious voices, so much evidence of American <br>\ngood will and wisdom, and so many fallen by the wayside! There were <br>\ntimes when I felt as if I were indeed standing at the edge of an <br>\nabyss, entrusted with rescuing pages of impeccable prose being blown <br>\npast me into oblivion, preserving what I could, surrendering all the <br>\nrest. (Those excellent essayists of a bygone time John Muir, Randolph <br>\nBourne, and John Jay Chapman are preserved here; surrendered to the <br>\nexigencies of space limitations are John Burroughs, George Santayana, <br>\nJoseph Wood Krutch, Ellen Glasgow, and others listed in the Appendix.)<br>\nMy belief is that art should not be comforting; for comfort, <br>\nwe have mass entertainment, and one another. Art should provoke, <br>\ndisturb, arouse our emotions, expand our sympathies in directions we <br>\nmay not anticipate and may not even wish. Art should certainly aspire <br>\nto beauty, but there are myriad sorts of beauty: the presentation of <br>\na subject in the most economical way, for instance; a precise choice <br>\nof language, of detail. There is beauty in the calibrated ugliness of <br>\nthe opening of William Gass's meditation on suicide and art, \"The <br>\nDoomed in Their Sinking,\" because it is so finely calibrated; there <br>\nis beauty in the eloquent, elegiac expression of hurt, rage, and <br>\ndespair in James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son,\" because it is <br>\neloquent and elegiac, in the service of art. That staple of <br>\ntraditional essay collections, the unhurried musings of a disembodied <br>\n(Caucasian, male, privileged) consciousness, is missing here, except <br>\nfor its highest, most lyric expression in E. B. White's classic \"Once <br>\nMore to the Lake\" and its total transmogrification in Edward <br>\nHoagland's powerful \"Heaven and Nature\" - which is about neither <br>\nheaven nor nature. (Hoagland, one of the few American writers who has <br>\nforged a brilliant career out of essays, is our Chopin of the genre. <br>\nThough best known for such nature essays as \"The Courage of <br>\nTurtles,\" \"Red Wolves and Black Bears,\" and \"Earth's Eye,\" in the <br>\ntradition of Thoreau, Hoagland is equally memorable as a recorder of <br>\nstartling, confessional utterances of a kind the very private Thoreau <br>\nwould not have dared.) Though there are deeply moving essays in the <br>\nnostalgic/musing mode by such fine writers as White, James Agee, <br>\nEudora Welty, and John Updike, I have given more space to what might <br>\nbe called a radical expansion of this familiar genre, essays that <br>\nhave the power of personal nostalgia yet are not sentimental, and in <br>\nwhich private contemplation touches on crucial public issues, as Zora <br>\nNeale Hurston's \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me,\" Richard <br>\nWright's \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow,\" Baldwin's \"Notes of a <br>\nNative Son,\" Loren Eiseley's \"The Brown Wasps,\" N. Scott <br>\nMomaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain,\" Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the <br>\nCaged Bird Sings,\" Richard Rodriguez's \"Aria: A Memoir of a Bilingual <br>\nChildhood,\" and others. If you begin Edmund Wilson's \"The Old Stone <br>\nHouse\" presuming it to be another nostalgic lament for a vanishing <br>\nAmerica, you will be shocked by the author's conclusion:<br>\nAnd what about me? As I come back in the train, I find that - other <br>\ncauses contributing - my depression of Talcottville deepens. I did <br>\nnot find the river and the forest of my dream - I did not find the <br>\nmagic of the past . . . I would not go back to that old life if I <br>\ncould: the civilization of northern New York - why should I idealize <br>\nit? - was too lonely, too poor, too provincial.<br>\nSimilarly, Donald Hall's \"A Hundred Thousand Straightened Nails\" is <br>\nboth a sympathetic portrait of an older relative of the writer's and <br>\na devastating critique of the romance of American rural eccentricity, <br>\nthe stock material of how many homespun reminiscences in the Norman <br>\nRockwell mode:<br>\n[Washington Woodward] worked hard all his life at being himself, but <br>\nthere were no principles to examine when his life was over . . . The <br>\nlife that he could recall totally was not worth recalling; it was a <br>\nbox of string too short to be saved.<br>\nApart from being first-rate reportage, Joan Didion's \"The White <br>\nAlbum\" can be seen as a radical variant of the genre of nostalgia as <br>\nwell, in which the essayist positions her intimate, interior life <br>\n(\"an attack of vertigo and nausea does not seem to me an <br>\ninappropriate response to the summer of 1968\") within the larger, <br>\nwayward, and \"poorly comprehended\" life of our culture circa 1966-<br>\n1978, with the defiant conclusion \"writing [this] has not yet helped <br>\nme to see what it means\": the antithesis of the traditional essay, <br>\nwhich was organized around a principle, or epiphany, toward which it <br>\nconfidently moved. So too Michael Herr's \"Illumination Rounds,\" from <br>\nDispatches, is appropriately ironically titled, for little is finally <br>\nilluminated in this account of a young American journalist's visit to <br>\nVietnam in the mid-seventies, at the height of that protracted and <br>\ntragic war; the techniques of vividly cinematic fiction writing are <br>\nhere employed in the service of the author's vision, but there is, <br>\nconspicuously, no \"moral\" - no \"moralizing.\" This is the art of the <br>\ncontemporary essay, or memoir: a heightened, trompe l'oeil attention <br>\nto detail that allows the reader to see, hear, witness, as if at <br>\nfirst hand, what the essayist has witnessed. Though this <br>\nis \"informal\" writing, there is no lack of form. Postmodernist <br>\nstrategies of fragmentation and collage have replaced that of <br>\nexposition, summary, and argument.<br>\n<br>\nFor all their diversity, essays tend to fall into three general <br>\ntypes: those that present opinions primarily, and have been written <br>\nto \"instruct\"; those that impart information and knowledge; and those <br>\nthat record personal impressionistic experiences, especially <br>\nmemories. These categories often overlap, of course, as in the <br>\noutstanding essays named above, and in recent years, judging from the <br>\nannual series The Best American Essays, from which essays in this <br>\nvolume published since 1985 have been taken, the genre has evolved <br>\ninto a form closely akin to prose fiction and prose poetry, employing <br>\ndialogue, dramatic scenes, withheld information, suspense.<br>\nThe essay of opinion, of which Montaigne (1533-1592) was an <br>\nearly, highly influential master, was for centuries the <br>\nquintessential essay. Here, you find no dialogue or dramatic scenes, <br>\nonly a rational, reasoning voice. Such an essay is an argument, often <br>\ncouched in conversational terms; its intention is to instruct, to <br>\nilluminate, to influence. Except for editorial and op-ed pages of <br>\nnewspapers, in which they appear in miniature form, and in a very few <br>\ngeneral-interest magazines like Harper's and the Atlantic, such <br>\nessays are not much favored today. In our egalitarian culture we tend <br>\nto feel, rightly or wrongly, that an essayist's opinion is only as <br>\ngood as his or her expertise, and in such uncharted areas as ethics, <br>\nmorals, and general wisdom, whose opinion should be taken more <br>\nseriously than anyone else's? In the past, however, the gentlemanly <br>\nart of opinion-offering was commonplace; Ralph Waldo Emerson is the <br>\nNorth American master of this form. With the publication of \"Nature\" <br>\nin 1836, Emerson's prestige and influence through the whole of the <br>\nnineteenth century was incalculable. Here was a brilliant aphoristic-<br>\nphilosophical mind expressed in an elegantly idiosyncratic language. <br>\nHenry David Thoreau, Emerson's younger contemporary, combines strong <br>\nopinions with a wealth of observed information and firsthand <br>\nexperience in a crystalline, poetic prose, and for this reason seems <br>\nto us more modern, and far more accessible, than Emerson. There is a <br>\nrich subcategory of American essays, the confrontation of nature by a <br>\nrefined, fastidiously observing consciousness, that has descended to <br>\nus from Thoreau; I would have dearly liked to include more <br>\npractitioners of this sort but had room for only John Muir, Rachel <br>\nCarson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, and Gretel Ehrlich. (But all <br>\nthese essays are gems.) In general, our patience tends to wear thin <br>\nwhen we're confronted with sermonizing in its many forms; I most <br>\noften encountered such essays among those published in the first four <br>\nor five decades of the century, when magazines seemed to have <br>\nunlimited space for rambling, genial prose by men with nothing <br>\nespecially urgent on their minds apart from platitudes of nature and <br>\nmorality. Who were the readers of these essays, I wondered. The more <br>\nelusive the subject, the more verbose the style, as in two <br>\nfascinating masterpieces of ellipsis, indirection, and irresolution <br>\nby Henry James at his most baroque, \"Is There a Life after Death?\" <br>\n(1910) and \"Within the Rim\" (1915). (\"Is There a Life after Death?\" <br>\nwas initially included in this volume, and then reluctantly excluded; <br>\nthen included again, and finally excluded. A longtime admirer of <br>\nHenry James, I wanted badly for him to be represented, but the essay <br>\nis, one might say, \"Jamesian,\" and long, and could hardly be <br>\njustified as among the best of the century. And \"Within the Rim,\" on <br>\nthe apparent theme of war, is even more abstruse.)<br>\nYet for all their unfashionableness, the opinion essays <br>\nincluded here are, I think, excellent, and will repay the sort of <br>\nclose, sympathetic reading required for prose that isn't immediately <br>\ngripping and specific. Henry Adams's \"A Law of Acceleration,\" from <br>\nthe classic The Education of Henry Adams, is a bravura work of <br>\nastonishing intellectual abstraction; written nearly one hundred <br>\nyears ago, it strikes a disturbingly contemporary note in its somber <br>\ncontemplation of a mechanistic universe reduced to a series <br>\nof \"relations\" and mankind itself reduced to \"Motion in a universe of <br>\nMotions, with an acceleration . . . of vertiginous violence.\" With <br>\nthe authority of science, Adams says, history has no right to meddle, <br>\nsince science \"now lay in a plane where scarcely one or two hundred <br>\nminds in the world could follow its mathematical processes.\" <br>\nFittingly, William James's famous \"The Moral Equivalent of War\" was <br>\nwritten in the same year, 1910, as Henry James's \"Is There a Life <br>\nafter Death?\" Though William James is a far more lucid prose stylist <br>\nthan his younger brother, both brothers are concerned with profound <br>\nquestions of life and death; William James broods upon the future of <br>\ncivilization itself in a prophetic work that looks ahead to Freud's <br>\nlate, melancholic Civilization and Its Discontents (1930). What is <br>\nhistory but a bloodbath? \"The horrors make the fascination. War is <br>\nthe strong life; it is life in extremis; war-taxes are the only ones <br>\nmen never hesitate to pay, as the budgets of all nations show us.\" <br>\nJohn Jay Chapman, once considered an essayist of nearly Emerson's <br>\nstature, is not much read today, yet his passionate meditation upon a <br>\nnotorious lynching that took place in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, in <br>\n1911 transcends its time and tragic circumstances.<br>\nThe two most influential literary essays of the twentieth <br>\ncentury are perhaps T. S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual <br>\nTalent\" (\"The emotion of art is impersonal\") and Robert Frost's \"The <br>\nFigure a Poem Makes\" (\"No tears in the writer, no tears in the <br>\nreader\"); each gains from being read in conjunction with the other. <br>\nSui generis is Gertrude Stein's \"What Are Master-pieces and Why Are <br>\nThere So Few of Them,\" itself a masterpiece of polemics, an argument <br>\nthat convinces by sheer repetition:<br>\n. . . One has not identity [when] one is in the act of doing <br>\nanything. Identity is recognition, you know who you are because you <br>\nand others remember anything about yourself but essentially you are <br>\nnot that when you are doing anything. I am I because my little dog <br>\nknows me but, creatively speaking the little dog knowing that you are <br>\nyou and your recognizing that he knows, is what destroys creation.<br>\nH. L. Mencken's \"The Hills of Zion\" is, like many of <br>\nMencken's essays and columns, a passionate repudiation of evangelical <br>\nChristianity and anti-intellectualism. This is sermonizing disguised <br>\nas social satire, zestful in its accumulation of damning details; one <br>\ncan see why the young Negro Richard Wright was so impressed by <br>\nMencken's example, seeing the older white man as \"fighting, fighting <br>\nwith words . . . using words as a weapon . . . as one would use a <br>\nclub.\" Katherine Anne Porter's \"The Future Is Now\" is an almost <br>\npurely cerebral opinion piece, less compelling perhaps than Porter's <br>\nelegantly composed short stories, but gracefully argued nonetheless, <br>\nwhile \"Artists in Uniform,\" one of Mary McCarthy's most anthologized <br>\nessays, smoothly combines her satirical gifts with her passion for <br>\nintellectual discourse. Susan Sontag's \"Notes on Camp\" is both <br>\nopinion essay and cultural criticism of a high order; Adrienne Rich's <br>\ndramatically fragmented \"Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying\" might <br>\nbe defined as an essay of opinion in a unique, poetic form. Essays by <br>\nAlice Walker, Richard Rodriguez, N. Scott Momaday, and Cynthia Ozick <br>\nadvance arguments by means of an accumulation of memoirist detail, <br>\nand each presents us with the wonder of how, in Ozick's words, \"a <br>\nwriter is dreamed and transfigured into being.\" And essays that seem <br>\nto be primarily concerned with the imparting of information and <br>\ndescription, like Loren Eiseley's \"The Brown Wasps,\" Tom <br>\nWolfe's \"Putting Daddy On,\" Elizabeth Hardwick's \"The Apotheosis of <br>\nMartin Luther King,\" Lewis Thomas's \"The Lives of a Cell,\" Annie <br>\nDillard's \"Total Eclipse,\" among others, contain arguments of <br>\nsubtlety and insight. Saul Bellow's \"Graven Images\" is a meditation <br>\nin the author's characteristic ironic mode on photography as a <br>\nviolation of personal dignity and privacy and the \"revolutionary <br>\ntransformation\" of a world that no longer honors such values. John <br>\nMcPhee's wonderfully original \"The Search for Marvin Gardens\" makes <br>\nof the popular American board game an allegory of capitalist <br>\nadventure, and rewards us with the unexpected discovery of the <br>\nsecluded middle-class bastion Marvin Gardens, the security-<br>\npatrolled \"suburb within a suburb\" that is one's reward for winning <br>\nthe game.<br>\nThe earliest essay in the anthology, Mark Twain's \"Corn-pone <br>\nOpinions,\" is a superbly modulated argument that begins with an <br>\nengaging portrait of a young black slave (this is the Missouri of <br>\nTwain's childhood, in the 1850s) and proceeds to a ringing <br>\ndenunciation of cultural chauvinism that is as relevant to our time <br>\nas it was to Twain's:<br>\nBroadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly <br>\nspeaking, corn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is <br>\nacquired mainly from the approval of other people. The result is <br>\nconformity.<br>\nBy which Twain means that deathly conformity that leads to an <br>\nacceptance of slavery, lynchings, white bigotry, and injustice in a <br>\nnation constituted as a democracy.<br>\nTwain's essay strikes a chord that resounds through the <br>\nanthology: the ever-shifting, ever-evolving issue of race in America. <br>\nIt can't be an accident that the essays in this volume by men and <br>\nwomen of ethnic minority backgrounds are outstanding; to paraphrase <br>\nMelville, to write a \"mighty\" work of prose you must have a \"mighty\" <br>\ntheme. And what mightier, what more challenging and passionate theme <br>\nfor both writer and reader than how it feels to be of minority status <br>\nin America, from the time of W.E.B. Du Bois in the first decade of <br>\nthe century to our contemporaries Maya Angelou, N. Scott Momaday, <br>\nMaxine Hong Kingston, Alice Walker, Richard Rodriguez, and Gerald <br>\nEarly? For historical reasons obviously having to do with slavery, <br>\nthe experience of blacks in America has been significantly different <br>\nfrom that of other minorities, and this fact is reflected in the <br>\nessays included here.<br>\nW.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" from The Souls of <br>\nBlack Folk (1903), is a chillingly prophetic work that traces the <br>\nintellectual and spiritual evolution of a seemingly ordinary black <br>\nboy from southeastern Georgia who is sent north to be educated in a <br>\nNegro school, returns after seven years to his hometown so thoroughly <br>\nchanged that he seems more foreign to his former relatives and <br>\nneighbors than a Georgian white man would be, and is given advice by <br>\nthe kindly white Judge:<br>\n\". . . You and I both know, John, that in this country the Negro must <br>\nremain subordinate, and can never expect to be the equal of white <br>\nmen. In their place, you people can be honest and respectful; and God <br>\nknows, I'll do what I can to help them. But when they want to reverse <br>\nnature . . . by God! we'll hold them under if we have to lynch every <br>\nNigger in the land.\"<br>\nZora Neale Hurston in \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me\" (1928) defines <br>\nherself very differently from Du Bois's tragic protagonist, partly <br>\nbecause she has been raised in a \"colored town\" in Florida, <br>\nEatonville. Her defiance strikes us as courageous, and touching:<br>\nAt certain times I have no race, I am me . . . Sometimes, I feel <br>\ndiscriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely <br>\nastonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my <br>\ncompany! It's beyond me.<br>\nRichard Wright's \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow: An Autobiographical <br>\nSketch,\" the preface to Wright's 1938 collection of novellas, Uncle <br>\nTom's Children, would become a section of his heralded Black Boy <br>\n(1945). Wright's education in Jim Crow \"wisdom\" begins ironically <br>\nwith a beating his mother gives him for having dared to fight with <br>\nwhite boys, and carries him into a prematurely cynical adolescence; <br>\nit's a vision of the American South contiguous with that of New York <br>\nCity in the 1940s experienced by Langston Hughes.<br>\nPerhaps the preeminent essayist of the American twentieth <br>\ncentury is James Baldwin, and it seems fitting that Baldwin wrote his <br>\nmost powerful and influential nonfiction works, Notes of a Native <br>\nSon, Nobody Knows My Name, and The Fire Next Time, at about <br>\nmidcentury. Baldwin was a natural master of a kind of nonfiction <br>\nnarration we associate with the most engaging fiction, in which <br>\npersonal, familial experience is linked with a larger social and <br>\npolitical context that enhances it as myth. Like his mentor Richard <br>\nWright, James Baldwin was a poet of irony; his bitterness and rage at <br>\nsocial injustice was so finely distilled, his use of language so <br>\nimpassioned and fluent, he made of the most tragically debased <br>\nmaterials a world of startling beauty. Baldwin's is a secular <br>\nmystical vision that seems to us quintessentially American:<br>\nAll of my [newly deceased] father's texts and songs, which I had <br>\ndecided were meaningless, were arranged before me at his death like <br>\nempty bottles, waiting to hold the meaning which life would give them <br>\nfor me. This was his legacy: nothing is ever escaped . . . The dead <br>\nman mattered, the new life mattered; blackness and whiteness did not <br>\nmatter; to believe they did was to acquiesce in one's own <br>\ndestruction. Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to <br>\ndestroy the man who hated and this man was an immutable law.<br>\nThis is the vision of Martin Luther King, Jr., expressed in <br>\nhis historic 1963 \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\": \"One who breaks an <br>\nunjust law must do it openly, lovingly . . . and with a willingness <br>\nto accept the penalty.\"<br>\n<br>\nRobert Atwan, who has been an invaluable series editor for the highly <br>\nregarded The Best American Essays since its inception in 1986, <br>\nassisted me tirelessly and with inspiration in our months-long effort <br>\nof sifting through any and all essays that were possibilities for <br>\nthis anthology. We have been limited, or, one might say, assisted, in <br>\nour selections only since 1986, being obliged to choose essays from <br>\nthe series anthology after that date; before 1986, we had no <br>\nrestrictions. Our decision to reprint essays only by writers who have <br>\npublished nonfiction books helped to limit our search, as did our <br>\nexclusion of journalism, excepting unique reportage like <br>\nHemingway's \"Pamplona in July\" and Michael Herr's \"Illumination <br>\nRounds.\" We hoped to avoid prose fiction in essay form, though such <br>\nprose pieces as W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John\" and Langston <br>\nHughes's \"Bop\" certainly employ fictional techniques; we excluded <br>\nliterary criticism - though some of our finest writers, like Randall <br>\nJarrell, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling, have excelled in it - <br>\nand footnote-laden academic essays for a limited readership, even by <br>\nHannah Arendt. Much as I wanted to include Henry James, as I've noted <br>\nabove, I could not justify reprinting a long, convoluted skein of <br>\nwords that few readers would read. Nor could I include another major <br>\ntwentieth-century writer, Willa Cather, whose available essays were <br>\nsimply inappropriate, and lengthy. Of Norman Mailer's nonfiction <br>\nwork, \"The Fight\" would have been my choice for this volume, but it's <br>\nbook length (and has already appeared in The Best American Sports <br>\nWriting of the Century); other essays of Mailer's, like \"The White <br>\nNegro,\" controversial in their time, are badly dated today. Gay <br>\nTalese, a brilliant practitioner of what has come to be known as New <br>\nJournalism, has written no \"essays\" per se. William Carlos Williams, <br>\nRalph Ellison, John Hersey, Wallace Stegner, Barbara Tuchman, Gore <br>\nVidal, most painfully William Faulkner: these important writers had <br>\nno single appropriate essay. Faulkner in particular seems to have had <br>\nlittle aptitude, or perhaps inspiration, for the essay form.<br>\nOf contemporary essayists there are so many - so very many! - <br>\nwho might well be included here, it isn't possible to list their <br>\nnames except in the Appendix. Quite apart from the numerous memoirs <br>\nof high quality being written today, and published to much acclaim, <br>\nthis is a remarkably fruitful era for the personal essay. The <br>\ntriumph, one might say, of the mysterious pronoun \"I.\"<br>\nIt was the aim of the editors to tell a more or less <br>\nchronological story of America as the century unfolded, with <br>\nrepresentative essays from each decade, as we have done; yet, the <br>\nreader will note, the traumatic experiences of World War II, vividly <br>\ndescribed by William Manchester in \"Okinawa: The Bloodiest Battle of <br>\nAll,\" does not appear in the forties but decades later, in 1987; and <br>\nnumerous other essays, stimulated by memory and meditation, have been <br>\nwritten years after the occasion of their subjects. The ideal essay, <br>\nin any case, is as timeless as any work of art, transcending the <br>\ncircumstances of its inception. It moves, as Robert Frost says of the <br>\nideal poem, from delight to wisdom, and \"rides on its own melting,\" <br>\nlike ice on a hot stove.<br>\nJoyce Carol Oates <br>\n<br>\nCopyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company<br>\nIntroduction copyright © 2000 by The Ontario Review Inc.<br>\nAll rights reserved",
    "synopsis": "<p><p>This singular collection is nothing less than a political, spiritual, and intensely personal record of America&#8217;s tumultuous modern age, as experienced by our foremost critics, commentators, activists, and artists. Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience.<br> From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s &#147;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&#8221; these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, &#147;into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we&#8217;ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.&#8221; Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>\"Here is a history of America told in many voices,\" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy's \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4><b>Bookseller Reviews</b> \n<p>These essays educate us, amuse us, startle us with their immediacy. Who among us can read Henry Adam's \"A Law of Acceleration,\" penned in 1904, and not think of our mind-zapping digital age? Who could resist the first sentence of Zora Neale Hurston's piece:I am colored but I offer nothing in the way of extenuating circumstances except the fact that I am the only Negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother's side was not an Indian chief.\" And which of you could disagree with the unrepeatable wisdom of Gertrude Stein's \"The tradition has always been that you may more or less describe the things that happen nowadays everybody all day long knows what is happening and so what is happening is not really interesting.\"</p>\n<p>The essays that Joyce Carol Oates has selected linger with us, not because their authors (from Mark Twain to Martin Luther King), retain their fame, but because each piece is a talisman, irreducible and well-carved. James Age's prose-poems \"Knoxville, Summer of 1915\" appeals to us today just as it inspired composer Samuel Barber decades ago, and two thirds of a century have only enhanced the thrall of the languorous rhythms of Edmund Wilson's \"The Old Stone House.\" H.L. Mencken's article on the 1925 Scopes trial shames this week's pale convention prose with its freshness, and T.S. Eliot's 1919 \"Tradition and The Individual Talent\" still has something to teach us.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                            </h4>\"Here is a history of America told in many voices,\" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy's \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities. QPB and History Book Club selections; BOMC alternate. Sept. Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From The Critics</h4>\". . . Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces <br>\nreflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of <br>\nvarious American identities.\"\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>KLIATT</h4>In her excellent introduction to this collection, Joyce Carol Oates states her belief that \"art should not be comforting.\" It should, instead, \"provoke, disturb,...and expand our sympathies in directions we may not anticipate and may not even wish.\" The reader should therefore be prepared to have these 55 carefully selected essays do just that. Arranged chronologically, the essays span the century with an average of five essays per decade. From Mark Twain to Saul Bellow by way of William James, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost and Gertrude Stein, the collection notes literary trends as well as social upheavals as recorded in essays of W.E.B DuBois, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright. Chosen from authors who had published at least one book of nonfiction or essays, this collection attempts to present a \"mobile mosaic\" of 20th-century America. Category: Collections. KLIATT Codes: SA—Recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2001, Houghton Mifflin, 624p., Ages 16 to adult. Reviewer: Patricia A. Moore; Brookline, MA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>One of the pleasures of an anthology like this is reading people you might not otherwise have picked up. Like John Muir, whose \"Stickeen,\" a life-and-death adventure on an Alaskan glacier with a singular small black dog, is a great piece of adventure writing. Or Jane Addams, whose insights into the spread of an urban legend of \"The Devil Baby at Hull House\" are thoughtful and compassionate. Another sort of pleasure comes from rereading familiar works in a new context: E.B. White's \"Once More to the Lake,\" N. Scott Momaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain,\" John McPhee's \"The Search for Marvin Gardens,\" and Annie Dillard's \"Total Eclipse.\" Only seven of the essays come from the annual \"Best American Essays\" series that Atwan has coedited since 1986. The other 48 were culled from the rest of the century, with the ruling idea, Atwan says, \"that the essays should speak to the present, not merely represent the past.\" Oates looked \"for the expression of personal experience within the historical.\" They have created a mosaic of a century in an America whose dominant and recurring theme has been race. Essential for most libraries.--Mary Paumier Jones, Westminster P.L., CO Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\\\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Megan Harlan</h4>...all the essays transcend fashion and speak just as eloquestly to us today as they did when they were first published.<br>\n—<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>\n\n</article>"

Elizabeth Hun Schmidt has gathered and introduced poems by each of the forty-three poets who have been named our nation’s poets laureate since the post (originally called Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress) was established in 1937. Poets range from Robert Pinsky, William Carlos Williams, and Elizabeth Bishop to Charles Simic, Billy Collins, and Rita Dove. Schmidt’s spirited introductions place the poets and their poems in historical and literary context and shine light on the interesting and often uneasy relationship between politics and art. This is an inviting, monumental collection for everyone’s library, containing much of the best poetry written in America over the last century.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>The United States has a long tradition of choosing a national poet, though the term poet laureate only came to be used here after 1985. Before that, since its inception in 1935, the post was called consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. So far we've had 43 of them, including some of America's most famous and best-loved poets, such as Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, and, of course, Billy Collins, perhaps the most popular poet to hold the title (2001–2003), and also the author of the foreword to this enjoyable anthology, which offers a sampling of work from all 43 laureates, plus short introductions about each one. Former New York Times Book Review poetry editor Schmidt calls the laureates \"the gatekeepers of the American idiom,\" and above all, that's what a reader will find here: a good sampling of what the mainstream of American poetry has to offer--the careful descriptions of Bishop, the powerful critiques of Brooks, the surreal landscapes of Simic, Merwin's deep images, Bogan's careful stanzas, Lowell's blustery lines. There are a few occasional poems, but mostly, it's a gathering of great poets hanging together because they held an important job. This will be a wonderful holiday gift for poetry lovers. (Oct.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>\"Be careful what you say to us now./ The street-lamp is smashed, the window is jagged,/ There is a man dead in his blood by the base of the fountain./ If you speak/ You cannot be delicate or sad or clever.\" With these lines, Josephine Jacobsen reminds readers that despite all the hardship in the world, poetry is there to report. With this sweeping behemoth of an anthology, Norton and the Library of Congress have given readers and libraries an excellent excuse to own another book. Schmidt, former poetry editor for the New York Times Book Review, has included all of the Poet Laureate Consultants (commonly known as U.S. Poet Laureates) from Joseph Auslander (1937–41) to Kay Ryan (2007–10). Even newly named Poet Laureate W.S. Merwin is included because he served as Special Bicentennial Consultant with Rita Dove and Louise Glück (1999–2000). Schmidt gives readers a fine selection of poems for each poet, some expected and some surprises. In addition, she includes introductions that place poets in social and literary context and elaborates their contributions to the office of Consultant. For example, William Carlos Williams's term was mired in Communist controversy and health problems, and while appointed, he never served. VERDICT A hefty and worthy read that everyone will want to savor. Essential for all contemporary poetry collections.—Karla Huston, Appleton Arts Ctr., WI\n\n</article>"

The novels of such leading figures as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs lend themselves well to excerpting, giving this volume creditable ballast. Representative works of Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gary Snyder are included along with those of lesser-known Beats (e.g., John Clellon Holmes), fellow travelers like Frank O'Hara and Amiri Baraka, and wives and girlfriends often overlooked at the time, including Hettie Jones, Carolyn Cassady and Joyce Johnson. Charters ( Kerouac ) offers a broad perspective on this seminal literary movement: she links East Coast Beats to the San Francisco Renaissance poets; pays attention to such latter-day Beats as Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg; and explains the position of non-Beat but related writers--Alan Watts, Anne Waldman, Diane DiPrima and the young Norman Mailer--in her helpful introductory essay and notes preceeding each entry. Her energizing, liberating anthology makes it clear that such Beat preoccupations as the bomb, the meaninglessness of modern existence and ecological destruction remain current. ( Jan. )</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>Dazzling in its range, exhilarating in its immediacy and grace, this collection gathers together, from every region of the country and from the past forty years, the poems that continue to shape our imaginations. From Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, John Ashbery and Adrienne Rich, to Robert Haas and Louise Gluck, this anthology takes the full measure of our poetry's daring energies and its tender understandings.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Poetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                                        </h4>Poetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Alluding to the anthology wars of a generation ago, McClatchy writes in his introduction that his choices are strictly nonpartisan (neither ``Paleface or Redskin, or Academic and Avant-Garde''). But from the 65 poets he has selected to represent the course of American poetry over the last half century--beginning with Robert Lowell and ending with Jorie Graham--it is clear his preferences are formalistic and academic. The typical poem a reader will encounter in these pages is urbane, finely honed, and smoothly accomplished. As in all anthologies, the omissions and inclusions are telling. Where are Rexroth, Kees, and Rukeyser? Why Cunningham, Bowers, Feldman, and Garrigue and not Ignatow, Brooks, Blackburn, and Bly? While it is a delight to have many of the poets McClatchy has chosen collected together in a reasonably priced edition, a greater variety of voice and aesthetic would have made this anthology a livelier survey of the state of contemporary American poetry. Still, it is a useful addition to most collections. For the 100 most anthologized poems in English, see review of The Concise Columbia Book of Poetry, p. 74.--Ed.-- Christine Sten strom, New York Law Sch. Lib.\n\n</article>"

Organized chronologically with a thematic appendix and streamlined apparatus, this anthology can be taylored to however the course is taught. Individual Fiction, Poetry, and Drama introductions provide an overview for reading and analyzing each genre, defining key terms in context. More than a third of the selections overall represent voices of women, people of color, and writers from cultures outside the United States, and a strong effort has been made to include work that reflects contemporary social questions and will stimulate classroom discussion. New poems, stories, and plays are among the changes to the Fourth Edition.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<b>I'll Fly Away</b><br>\nFurther Testimonies from the Women of York Prison \n<p><b>Chapter One</b></p>\n<p class=\"null1\">Florida Memories</p>\n<p>By Bonnie Jean Foreshaw</p>\n<p>It's Thursday morning at 6:00 <small>A.M.</small>, and we two have just arrived at the open-air flea market, the largest in south Florida. I'm an apprentice shopper and my teacher is my Aunt Mandy. Later this morning, the market will be hot and crowded—alive with music, laughter, gossip, and bartering about the price of everything from necklaces to nectarines. But at the moment, it's cool and quiet. Our focus is fish.</p>\n<p>\"Pay close attention to the <i>eyes</i> of the fish,\" Aunt Mandy instructs as we walk from stall to stall. \"If the eyes are clear, not cloudy, and the color of the skin's not fading, then the fish is fresh.\" Auntie's dressed for shopping in a pink sleeveless blouse, burgundy pedal pushers, Italian sandals, and a white sun visor. I'm wearing shorts, a T-shirt, and rubber flip-flops. I am tall for my age, and starting to get the kind of shape men take a second look at. My glasses take up half my face. \"But you have to shop with your finger and your nose, too, not just your eyes,\" Auntie instructs. \"Poke the fish gently near its fin. If it leaves a dent, then you don't want it. If it doesn't, it's probably part of the morning's catch. And listen to me, Jeannie. Fresh fish never smells foul.\"</p>\n<p>We stop at one of the stalls where the fish are lined up, one against the other, on a bed of ice. The fish man approaches us. He's handsome—black hair, hazel eyes, tank top and cut-off jeans. \"May I help you, ma'am?\" I watch him take in Aunt Mandy's curves, her green eyes andhoney-colored complexion. I might as well be invisible.</p>\n<p>\"Well, maybe you can,\" Auntie says. \"Oh, by the way, I'm Mandy and this is my niece, Jeannie. Now what's your name?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm Ricardo,\" the fish man says. He's sucking in his stomach, and his feet are moving up and down like he's trying to stretch his height. \"It's nice to meet you, Mandy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nice to meet you, too. Now tell me, Ricardo, how much you want for these five yellowtails?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, let's see. They're seventy-five cents apiece, so that's a total of . . .\"</p>\n<p>He stops to watch Auntie pass her fingers through her shoulder-length hair. It's salt-and-pepper-colored, but Mandy's still got it. \"Uh, three seventy-five.\" \"Oh,\" Auntie says, half-shocked and half-disappointed. \"That fellow three stalls down says he's selling his yellowtails for <i>fifty</i> cents each. So unless we can work out a deal . . .\"</p>\n<p>The smile drops off of Mr. Ricardo's face, but Auntie's smile returns. Her gold tooth is glimmering. She shifts her weight, puts her hand on her hip.</p>\n<p>\"Mandy, it's a deal,\" Ricardo says. \"Five yellowtails for two-fifty. That's a dollar twenty-five cut I'm giving you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which I appreciate,\" Auntie says. \"And look at it this way: you've just gained yourself a faithful customer. Now, tell me. How much you selling those red snappers for? If I can get them for the same price as the yellowtails, I'll buy some of them, too. And conch.\"</p>\n<p>I stand there looking from one to the other. Auntie touches the small gold cross at her throat. She fingers her earring. I can tell Mr. Ricardo is only pretending to do the math in his head. \"Okay,\" he finally says. \"Sold.\"</p>\n<p>Auntie pays for the fish and conch, thanks him, and we walk away. A few stalls down from Mr. Ricardo's, she turns to me. \"Okay, now,\" she says. \"Show me a fresh fish.\"</p>\n<p>I go up and down the row, looking each fish in the eye, then pick one up by its tail. I turn it, look at its other eye, study its coloration. When I press my finger against its head, near the fin, there's no indentation. \"This one.\"</p>\n<p>Her look is serious. \"You think this fish is fresh?\"</p>\n<p>I hesitate. \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Aunt Mandy flashes me her gold-toothed smile. \"Well, Jeannie, now you know how to pick fresh fish.\"</p>\n<p>I'm excited to have passed the test, but I've been wondering something. \"Auntie?\" I say. \"I don't remember going to any other fish stalls before we went to Mr. Ricardo's.\"</p>\n<p>She laughs. \"You and I knew that, but Ricardo didn't. It's one of the tricks of the trade when you shop at the flea market. But bear in mind, Ricardo would rather make a sale than not sell. If he has fish left at the end of the day, that's a loss and a waste for him. So we were doing him a favor. Now, come on. Let's cross the street and I'll teach you how to pick out vegetables and fruit.\"</p>\n<p>We meander among the tomatoes and squashes, the potatoes and mangoes and plums. Shopping for fresh produce is a matter of looking and smelling, but mostly of <i>feeling</i>, Auntie says. \"Fruits and vegetables can get damaged by cold weather, the way they're packed, or how far they've traveled to get to the market. If the skin is firm, that means it's fresh. If it's loose, then it isn't. And always check for bruises.\"</p>\n<p>Although I'm listening to my aunt, it's the peaches in the stall to my right that have my attention. They're big and beautiful, golden yellow with blushes of pink, and their aroma makes my mouth juice up. I'm thinking about how I might get myself one of those peaches.</p>\n<p>\"Pick us out some bananas,\" Auntie says. It's test number two.</p>\n<p>My eyes pass over several bunches before I pick one up. I check each banana, one by one, then walk over to Auntie, who is examining pears. \"These are nice, firm, and yellow,\" I say, handing her the bunch I've chosen. \"Tight skin, no bruises.\"</p>\n<p>She twists the bunch back and forth, then nods her approval. \"Good job,\" she says. Smiling all over myself, I decide to seize the moment. \"Auntie, may I get a few peaches?\"</p>\n<i><b>I'll Fly Away</b><br>\nFurther Testimonies from the Women of York Prison</i>.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>In 1998, Wally Lamb began teaching writing to female convicts at Connecticut's York Correctional Institute. It was not for lack of a résumé; he was already an acclaimed novelist (<i>I Know This Much Is True; She's Come Undone</i>) and had been teaching high school for a quarter century. York was something different. After adjusting to his new constituency, Lamb realized that his students had disarming, often frightening stories to tell. In 2003, he published an anthology of these testimonies, the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award-winning <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>. This follow-up collection is just as bracing and profound.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booklist</h4>\"Lamb . . . continues to offer readers an intimate look at women struggling to maintain their humanity.\"\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4><p>Novelist Lamb's (<i>I Know This Much Is True</i>) second collection of writing by the students in his writing workshop at the maximum-security York Correctional Institution in Connecticut, after <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>(2003), also focuses on the inspiring and raw emotions of women sharing the good and bad memories that shaped them. The 20 women whose work is featured here-18 inmates and two of Lamb's cofacilitators-show that writing is not just a way of capturing their most private thoughts and gripping emotions (e.g., hope, despair, courage), but also a powerful tool to foster hope and healing. They write from the heart in works ranging from poems to essays to short stories; each vignette is more compelling than the one before it. Highly recommended for academic and public libraries.<br>\n—Susan McClellan</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>The second accomplished collection of writings from women incarcerated in Connecticut's York Correctional Institution, edited again by bestselling novelist Lamb (Couldn't Keep It to Myself: Testimonies from Our Imprisoned Sisters, 2003, etc.). One would have thought the first volume, with its probing examinations of lives run amok, would have convinced prison authorities of the value of a writing program in which prisoners focus and take account. But the prison bureaucracy tried to shut it down, writes an incredulous and furious Lamb, and they confiscated the prisoners' material. That particular draconian administration was replaced with a more enlightened group, Lamb reports, one that allowed for the rehabilitative value of writing. These works radiate what Lamb saw as the program's critical mission: to give the women wings \"to hover above the confounding maze of their lives, and from that perspective . . . to see the patterns and dead ends of their past, and a way out.\" Some of the stories are rueful, others bitter, but all bite, even-perhaps especially-when they are gentle. None are self-pitying, but none shy away from speaking directly to the gross cruelties so often inflicted on their early years or young marriages. Each story, no matter how grim or gritty, shows polish, and the women display a wide array of emotions: unbridled anger, innocence, hope, resigned acceptance. While a few of the stories speak of angels who touched the women's lives, most display open wounds that are continuing to be healed by the cathartic power of words. Writing as an act of self-realization and liberation and, not incidentally, an indictment of the penal system.\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<b>AMERICAN EARTH</b> <b>Environmental Writing Since Thoreau</b> <br>\n <b>By Bill McKibben</b> <br>\n <b>THE LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> <b>Copyright © 2008</b> <b>Literary Classics of the United States, New York, NY.<br>\n All right reserved.</b><br>\n <b>ISBN: 978-1-59853-020-9</b> <br>\n <br>\n<br>\n <br>\n <b>Chapter One</b> <b>HENRY DAVID THOREAU</b> \n<p>Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was born, grew up, lived out his life, and died in Concord, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard from 1833 to 1837, then signed on as a teacher at Concord Academy but was dismissed for refusing to whip students. He and his brother John opened an elementary school in 1838, where, according to some authorities, they invented the idea of the field trip. John became sick in 1841 and the brothers closed the school; Henry went to live with Ralph Waldo Emerson, beginning a long friendship with him and with the other members of the Transcendental Club, among them Bronson Alcott and Margaret Fuller. The other transcendentalists experimented with communes like Brook Farm, but Thoreau was more solitary, and the most important years in his life began in 1845 when he took up residence in a small cabin he'd built on the shore of Walden Pond a short walk from town. He spent two years, two months, and two days there, experimenting with simplifying his life. Thorean's isolation at Walden wasn't absolute or deliberately ascetic-he often returned to town to see friends and eat meals, had a steady stream of visitors (often too steady for his taste), and at one point engaged in a political protest, spending a night in Concord jail for his refusal to pay his poll tax. But it was notably productive: he returned to town with the draft of one book (<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>) and the notes that he would spend the next six years turning into <i>Walden</i> (1854), perhaps the most remarkable book in the American canon. As dense as scripture, crowded with aphorism, <i>Walden</i> is full of enough ideas for a score of ordinary books. But it has lived as long and as fully as any other writing of its vintage and inspired all the best kinds of people: both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. claimed him as a major influence. Thoreau suffered from tuberculosis contracted during his college years: his condition worsened beginning in 1859, and he spent his last years revising his accounts of the Maine woods and other works. As he neared death his aunt Louisa asked him if he had made his peace with God. \"I did not know we had ever quarreled,\" he said. He died at the age of 44.</p>\n<p>Picking a few fragments from his writings is an impossible task: an anthology of American environmental writing might well be one-third Thoreau. Here are a few entries from his copious journals, and then the description from <i>Walden</i> of the building of the famous cabin. \"Huckleberries,\" a late essay or lecture-text, shows the modern nature essay being born, with a small root giving way to a luxuriant growth of thought and speculation.</p>\n<p><b><i>from Journals</i></b></p>\n<p>Oct. 24th 1837.</p>\n<p>The Mould our Deeds Leave.</p>\n<p>Every part of nature teaches that the passing away of one life is the making room for another. The oak dies down to the ground, leaving within its rind a rich virgin mould, which will impart a vigorous life to an infant forest - - The pine leaves a sandy and sterile soil-the harder woods a strong and fruitful mould. - -</p>\n<p>So this constant abrasion and decay makes the soil of my future growth. As I live now so shall I reap. If I grow pines and birches, my virgin mould will not sustain the oak, but pines and birches, or, perchance, weeds and brambles, will constitute my second growth. - -</p>\n<p>March 6th 1838</p>\n<p>- - How can a man sit down and quietly pare his nails, while the earth goes gyrating ahead amid such a din of sphere music, whirling him along about her axis some twenty four thousand miles between sun and sun? but mainly in a circle some two millions of miles actual progress. And then such a hurly-burly on the surface-wind always blowing-now a zephyr, now a hurricane-tides never idle, ever fluctuating, no rest for Niagara, but perpetual ran-tan on those limestone rocks-and then that summer simmering which our ears are used to-which would otherwise be christened confusion worse confounded, but is now ironically called \"silence audible\"-and above all the incessant tinkering named hum of industry-the hurrying to and fro and confused jabbering of men-Can man do less than get up and shake himself?</p>\n<p>April 24th 1838.</p>\n<p>Steam ships</p>\n<p>-Men have been contriving new means and modes of motion-Steam ships have been westering during these late days and nights on the Atlantic waves-the fuglers of a new evolution to this generation - - Meanwhile plants spring silently by the brook sides-and the grim woods wave indifferent-the earth emits no howl pot on fire simmers and seethes and men go about their business. - -</p>\n<p>Saturday March 19th 1842</p>\n<p>When I walk in the fields of Concord and meditate on the destiny of this prosperous slip of the Saxon <i>family</i>-the unexhausted energies of this new country-I forget that this which is now Concord was once Musketaquid and that the <i>American race</i> has had its destiny also. Everywhere in the fields-in the corn and grain land-the earth is strewn with the relics of a race which has vanished as completely as if trodden in with the earth.</p>\n<p>I find it good to remember the eternity behind me as well as the eternity before. Where ever I go I tread in the tracks of the Indian-I pick up the bolt which he has but just dropped at my feet. And if I consider destiny I am on his trail. I scatter his hearth stones with my feet, and pick out of the embers of his fire the simple but enduring implements of the wigwam and the chace-In planting my corn in the same furrow which yielded its increase to his support so long-I displace some memorial of him.</p>\n<p>I have been walking this afternoon over a pleasant field planted with winter rye-near the house. Where this strange people once had their dwelling place. Another species of mortal men but little less wild to me than the musquash they hunted-Strange spirits-daemons-whose eyes could never meet mine. With another nature-and another fate than mine- The crows flew over the edge of the woods, and wheeling over my head seemed to rebuke-as dark winged spirits more akin to the Indian than I. Perhaps only the present disguise of the Indian- If the new has a meaning so has the old.</p>\n<p>Nature has her russet hues as well as green-Indeed our eye splits on every object, and we can as well take one path as the other-If I consider its history it is old-if its destiny it is new-I may see a part of an object or the whole-I will not be imposed on and think nature is old, because the season is advanced I will study the botany of the mosses and fungi on the decayed-and remember that decayed wood is not old, but has just begun to be what it is. I need not think of the pine almond or the acorn and sapling when I meet the fallen pine or oak-more than of the generations of pines and oaks which have fed the young tree.</p>\n<p>The new blade of the corn-the third leaf of the melon-these are not green but gray with time, but sere in respect of time.</p>\n<p>September 12, 1851</p>\n<p>2 PM To the Three Friends' Hill beyond Flints Pond-via RR. RWEs Wood Path S side Walden-Geo Heywood's Cleared Lot &amp; Smith's orchards-return via E of Flints' P via Goose P &amp; my old home to RR-</p>\n<p>I go to Flints P. for the sake of the <i>Mt</i> view from the hill beyond looking over Concord. I have thought it the best especially in the winter which I can get in this neighborhood. It is worth the while to see the <i>Mts</i> in the horizon once a day. I have thus seen some earth which corresponds to my least earthly &amp; trivial-to my most heaven-ward looking thoughts-The earth seen through an azure an etherial veil. They are the natural <i>temples</i> elevated brows of the earth-looking at which the thoughts of the beholder are naturally elevated and etherialized. I wish to see the earth through the medium of much air or heaven-for there is no paint like the air. <i>Mts</i> thus seen are worthy of worship. I go to Flints' Pond also to see a rippling lake &amp; a reedy-island in its midst-Reed Island.</p>\n<p>A man should feed his senses with the best that the land affords</p>\n<p>At the entrance to the Deep Cut I heard the telegraph wire vibrating like an AÆolian Harp. It reminded me suddenly-reservedly with a beautiful paucity of communication-even silently, such was its effect on my thoughts-It reminded me, I say, with a certain pathetic moderation-of what finer &amp; deeper stirrings I was susceptible-which grandly set all argument &amp; dispute aside- -a triumphant though transient exhibition of the truth. It told me by the faintest imaginable strain-it told me by the finest strain that a human ear can hear-yet conclusively &amp; past all refutation-that there were higher infinitely higher plains of life-which it behoved me never to forget. As I was entering the Deep Cut the wind which was conveying a message to me from heaven dropt it on the wire of the telegraph which it vibrated as it past. I instantly sat down on a stone at the foot of the telegraph pole-&amp; attended to the communication. It merely said \"Bear in mind, Child &amp; never for an instant forget-that there are higher plains infinitely higher plains of life than this thou art now travelling on. Know that the goal is distant &amp; is upward and is worthy all your life's efforts to attain to.\" And then it ceased and though I sat some minutes longer I heard nothing more.</p>\n<p>There is every variety &amp; degree of inspiration from mere fullness of life to the most rapt mood. A human soul is played on even as this wire-which now vibrates slowly &amp; gently so that the passer can hardly hear it &amp; anon the sound swells &amp; vibrates with such intensity as if it would rend the wire-as far as the elasticity &amp; tension of the wire permits-and now it dies away and is silent-&amp; though the breeze continues to sweep over it, no strain comes from it-&amp; the traveller hearkens in vain. It is no small gain to have this wire stretched through Concord though there may be no Office here. Thus I make my own use of the telegraph-without consulting the Directors-like the sparrows which I perceive use it extensively for a perch.</p>\n<p>Shall I not go to this office to hear if there is any communication for me-as steadily as to the Post office in the village?</p>\n<p>Tuesday Dec 30th</p>\n<p>Mem. Go to the Deep Cut. The flies now crawl forth from the crevices all covered with dust, dreaming of summer-without life or energy enough to clean their wings</p>\n<p>This afternoon being on fair Haven Hill I heard the sound of a saw-and soon after from the cliff saw two men sawing down a noble pine beneath about 40 rods off. I resolved to watch it till it fell-the last of a dozen or more which were left when the forest was cut and for 15 years have waved in solitary majesty over the sproutland. I saw them like beavers or insects gnawing at the trunk of this noble tree, the diminutive mannikins with their crosscut saw which could scarcely span it. It towered up a hundred feet as I afterward found by measurement-one of the tallest probably now in the township &amp; straight as an arrow, but slanting a little toward the hill side.-its top seen against the frozen river &amp; the hills of Conantum. I watch closely to see when it begins to move. Now the sawers stop-and with an axe open it a little on the side toward which it leans that it may break the faster. And now their saw goes again-Now surely it is going-it is inclined one quarter of the quadrant, and breathless I expect its crashing fall-But no I was mistaken it has not moved an inch, it stands at the same angle as at first. It is 15 minutes yet to its fall. Still its branches wave in the wind as if it were destined to stand for a century, and the wind soughs through its needles as of yore; it is still a forest tree-the most majestic tree that waves over Musketaquid.-The silvery sheen of the sunlight is reflected from its needles-it still affords an inaccessible crotch for the squirrel's nest not a lichen has forsaken its mastlike stem- -its raking mast-the hill is the hull. Now's the moment the mannikins at its base are fleeing from their crime-they have dropped the guilty saw &amp; axe. How slowly &amp; majestically it starts-as if it were only swayed by a summer breeze and would return without a sigh to its location in the air-&amp; now it fans the hill side with its fall and it lies down to its bed in the valley from which it is never to rise, as softly as a feather, folding its green mantle about it like a warrior-as if tired of standing it embraced the earth with silent joy.-returning its elements to the dust again-but hark! there you only saw-but did not hear-There now comes up a deafening crash to these rocks-advertising you that even trees do not die without a groan. It rushes to embrace the earth, &amp; mingle its elements with the dust. And now all is still once more &amp; forever both to eye &amp; ear.</p>\n<p>I went down and measured it. It was about 4 feet in diameter where it was sawed-about 100 feet long. Before I had reached it-the axe-men had already half divested it of its branches. Its gracefully spreading top was a perfect wreck on the hill side as if it had been made of glass-&amp; the tender cones of one years growth upon its summit appealed in vain &amp; too late to the mercy of the chopper. Already he has measured it with his axe-and marked out the mill logs it will make. And the space it occupied in upper air is vacant for the next 2 centuries. It is lumber He has laid waste the air. When the fish hawk in the spring revisits the banks of the Musketaquid, he will circle in vain to find his accustomed perch.-&amp; the henhawk will mourn for the pines lofty enough to protect her brood. A plant which it has taken two centuries to perfect rising by slow stages into the heavens-has this afternoon ceased to exist. Its sapling top had expanded to this January thaw as the forerunner of summers to come. Why does not the village bell sound a knell. I hear no knell tolled-I see no procession of mourners in the streets-or the woodland aisles-The squirrel has leapt to another tree-the hawk has circled further off-&amp; has now settled upon a new eyre but the woodman is preparing to lay his axe at the root of that also.</p>\n<p>Dec 31st</p>\n<p>The 3d warm day. now overcast and beginning to drizzle. Still it is inspiriting as the brightest weather though the sun surely is not agoing to shine. There is a latent light in the mist-as if there were more electricity than usual in the air. These are warm foggy days in winter which excite us.</p>\n<p>It reminds me this thick spring like weather, that 1 have not enough valued and attended to the pure clarity &amp; brilliancy of the winter skies-Consider in what respects the winter sunsets differ from the summer ones. Shall I ever in summer evenings see so celestial a reach of blue sky contrasting with amber as I have seen a few days since-The day sky in winter corresponds for clarity to the night sky in which the stars shine &amp; twinkle so brightly in this latitude.</p>\n<p>I am too late perhaps, to see the sand foliage in the deep cut-should have been there day before yesterday-it is now too wet &amp; soft.</p>\n<p><i>(Continues...)</i></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote><br>\n Excerpted from <b>AMERICAN EARTH</b> by <b>Bill McKibben</b> Copyright © 2008 by Literary Classics of the United States, New York, NY..

Crumb, of Zap Comix fame, alongside lyrics by Marvin Gaye…Well selected, full of surprises and informed by McKibben's thoughtful commentary, <i>American Earth</i> is the first anthology of American nature writing to come close to the standard Thomas Lyon set two decades ago with <i>\"This Incomperable Lande\": A Book of American Nature Writing.</i> Ours is an incomparable land indeed, and McKibben's collection is a welcome reminder.<br>\n—The Washington Post\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4><p>In his introduction to this superb anthology, McKibben (<i>The End of Nature</i>) proposes that \"environmental writing is America's most distinctive contribution to the world's literature.\" The collected pieces amply prove the point. Arranged chronologically, McKibben's selection of more than 100 writers includes some of the great early conservationists, such as Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and John Burroughs, and many other eloquent nature writers, including Donald Cultross Peattie, Edwin Way Teale and Henry Beston. The early exponents of national parks and wilderness areas have their say, as do writers who have borne witness to environmental degradation-John Steinbeck and Caroline Henderson on the dust bowl, for example, and Berton Roueché and others who have reported on the effects of toxic pollution. Visionaries like Buckminster Fuller and Amory Lovins are represented, as are a wealth of contemporary activist/writers, among them Barry Lopez, Terry Tempest Williams, Barbara Kingsolver, Michael Pollan, Paul Hawken, and Calvin deWitt, cofounder of the Evangelical Environmental Network. McKibben's trenchant introductions to the pieces sum up each writer's thoughts and form a running commentary on the progress of the conservation movement. The book, being published on Earth Day, can be read as a survey of the literature of American environmentalism, but above all, it should be enjoyed for the sheer beauty of the writing. 80-page color illus, not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Apr. 22 [Earth Day])</i></p>\nCopyright 2007 Reed Business Information\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4><p>Adult/High School- There have been some excellent collections of nature writing published in recent years (<i>The Norton Anthology of Nature Writing</i> is one fine example), but not until now has there been a definitive anthology of American environmental writing. In this superbly edited volume, McKibben draws a clear distinction between the two. The best of the latter often celebrates nature, but also asks searching questions about the impact of human life on the planet. After a poignant foreword by Al Gore, as well as his own illuminating introduction, McKibben begins with the work of a writer, thinker, and activist ahead of his time, Henry David Thoreau, and ends the volume with Rebecca Solnit's essay, \"The Thoreau Problem.\" She notes that many people think of Thoreau only as a man alone observing nature, but the author of \"Civil Disobedience,\" before enjoying his day of huckleberry picking, spent a night in jail rather than pay taxes to a government guilty of ignoring the higher laws of nature. This vast and varied collection, arranged chronologically, includes many seminal names, such as John Muir, Rachel Carson, and Wendell Berry, and some that are less well known or unexpected, like Benton MacKaye, Caroline Henderson, P. T. Barnum, and Philip K. Dick. Most of the selections derive from longer prose works, but there is also a smattering of poems, song lyrics, and cartoons. Although the heft of the volume might scare away some teens, others may realize that they could easily read bits and pieces, and that they would benefit greatly by any amount of time spent in these pages. Numerous photographs, many in full color, are included.-<i>Robert Saunderson, Berkeley Public Library,CA</i></p>\n\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<b>The Best Poems of the English Language</b><br>\nFrom Chaucer Through Robert Frost \n<h3>Chapter One</h3>\n<h4>The Art of Reading Poetry</h4>\n<p>Poetry essentially is figurative language, concentrated so that its form is both expressive and evocative. Figuration is a departure from the literal, and the form of a great poem itself can be a trope (\"turning\") or figure. A common dictionary equivalent for \"figurative language\" is \"metaphorical,\" but a metaphor actually is a highly specific figure, or turning from the literal. Kenneth Burke, a profound student of rhetoric, or the language of figures, distinguished four fundamental tropes: irony, synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor. As Burke tells us, irony commits those who employ it to issues of presence and absence, since they are saying one thing while meaning something so different that it can be the precise opposite. We learn to wince when Hamlet says: \"I humbly thank you\" or its equivalent, since the prince generally is neither humble nor grateful.</p>\n<p>We now commonly call synecdoche \"symbol,\" since the figurative substitution of a part for a whole also suggests that incompletion in which something within the poem stands for something outside it. Poets frequently identify more with one trope than with the others. Among major American poets, Robert Frost (despite his mass reputation) favors irony, while Walt Whitman is the great master of synecdoche.</p>\n<p>In metonymy, contiguity replaces resemblance, since the name or prime aspect of anything is sufficient to indicate it, provided it is near in space to what serves as substitute. Childe Roland, in Browning's remarkable monologue, is represented at the very end by the \"slug-horn\" ortrumpet upon which he dauntlessly blows: \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.\"</p>\n<p>Metaphor proper transfers the ordinary associations of one word to another, as when Hart Crane beautifully writes \"peonies with pony manes,\" enhancing his metaphor by the pun between \"peonies\" and \"pony.\" Or again Crane, most intensely metaphorical of poets, refers to the Brooklyn Bridge's curve as its \"leap,\" and then goes on to call the bridge both harp and altar.</p>\n<p>Figurations or tropes create meaning, which could not exist without them, and this making of meaning is largest in authentic poetry, where an excess or overflow emanates from figurative language, and brings about a condition of newness. Owen Barfield's <i>Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning</i> is one of the best guides to this process, when he traces part of the poetic history of the English word \"ruin.\"</p>\n<p>The Latin verb <i>ruo</i>, meaning \"rush\" or \"collapse,\" led to the substantive <i>ruina</i> for what had fallen. Chaucer, equally at home in French and English, helped to domesticate \"ruin\" as \"a falling\":</p>\n<blockquote>Min is the ruine of the highe halles,<br>\n The falling of the towers and of the walles.</blockquote>\n<p>One feels the chill of that, the voice being Saturn's or time's in \"The Knight's Tale.\" Chaucer's disciple Edmund Spenser, has the haunting line:</p>\n<blockquote>The old ruines of a broken tower</blockquote>\n<p>My last selection in this book is Hart Crane's magnificent death ode, \"The Broken Tower,\" in which Spenser's line reverberates. Barfield emphasizes Shakespeare's magnificence in the employment of \"ruin,\" citing \"Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang\" from Sonnet 73, and the description of Cleopatra's effect upon her lover: \"The noble ruin of her magic, Antony.\" I myself find even stronger the blind Gloucester's piercing outcry when he confronts the mad King Lear (IV, VI, 134135):</p>\n<blockquote>O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world<br>\n Shall so wear out to nought.</blockquote>\n<p>Once Barfield sets one searching, the figurative power of \"ruined\" seems endless. Worthy of Shakespeare himself is John Donne, in his \"A Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's Day,\" where love resurrects the poet to his ruin:</p>\n<blockquote>Study me then, you who shall lovers be<br>\n At the next world, that is, at the next spring:<br>\n For I am every dead thing,<br>\n In whom love wrought new alchemy.<br>\n For his art did express<br>\n A quintessence even from nothingness,<br>\n From dull privations, and lean emptiness<br>\n He ruined me, and I am re-begot<br>\n Of absence, darkness, death; things which are not.</blockquote>\n<p>Barfield invokes what he rightly calls Milton's \"terrific phrase\": \"Hell saw / Heaven ruining from Heaven,\" and then traces Wordsworth's allusive return to Milton. Rather than add further instances, I note Barfield's insight, that the figurative power of \"ruin\" depends upon restoring its original sense of <i>movement</i>, of rushing toward a collapse. One of the secrets of poetic rhetoric in English is to romance the etonym (as it were), to renew what Walter Pater called the \"finer edges\" of words.</p>\n<i><b>The Best Poems of the English Language</b><br>\nFrom Chaucer Through Robert Frost</i>.

The promise of tomorrow. I don't know. It seems that poems are essential. Like football to Fall, baseball to Spring, tennis to Summer, love Anytime. Something you don't think too much about until it is in Season. Then you deliciously anticipate the perfection. African American poems are like all other poems: beautiful, loving, provocative, thoughtful, and all those other adjectives I can think of.</p>\n<p>Poems know no boundaries. They, like all Earth citizens, were born in some country, grew up on some culture, then in their blooming became citizens of the Universe. Poems fly from heart to heart, head to head, to whisper a dream, to share a condolence, to congratulate, and to vow forever. The poems are true. They are translated and they are celebrated. They are sung, they are recited, they are delightful. They are neglected. They are forgotten. They are put away. Even in their fallow periods they sprout images. And fight to be revived. And spring back to life with a bit of sunshine and caring.</p>\n<p>These poems, this book, admit I cheated. The idea of <i>this</i> and no more would simply not work for me. I needed <i>these</i> plus <i>those</i>. My mother's favorite poem by Robert Hayden, plus James Weldon Johnson beginning a world that included the longing of the unfree for a loving God. My own fun \"Ego Tripping\" reaching to embrace Margaret Walker's \"For My People.\" \"Train Rides\" and \"Nikki-Rosa\" read by old and loving friends. But also the newness: Novella Nelson lending that sultry voice to the youngsters; Ruby Dee bringing her brilliance to the Gwendolyn Brooks cycle. My Virginia Tech Family wanted to participate: our president Dr. Charles Steger reading \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers,\" recognizing all our souls \"have grown deep like the rivers.\" We celebrate our Hips; we See A Negro Lady at a birthday celebration. Our friends from James Madison University and West Virginia University came to celebrate poetry with us, too. I love these poems so much. The only other thing I would have loved is Caroline Kennedy reading \"A Clean Slate.\"</p>\n<p>At the end of a loving day of laughter in Jeff Dalton's studio, when Clinton's makeup had taken forty years off some of us and twenty-five off others, we all came together with one last great cry: the Dean of our College; the Director of Honors; young, old, professional, professor, and recited in one great voice \"We Real Cool.\" Yeah. We are. This book says Poetry Is For Everyone. What a Treat to be Snowbound with <i>The 100* Best African American Poems (*but I cheated)</i>.</p>\n<p>I did cheat.<br>\n It's true.<br>\n But I did not lie.</p>\n<p>Nikki Giovanni Poet<br>\n 12 December 2009</p>",

Selections are from America's greatest and most representative poets: Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, and Langston Hughes. Though one may cavil at particular omissions or inclusions, especially the practice of excerpting Whitman's ``Song of Myself,'' Conarroe's anthology is a superb introduction to the pleasures of poetry for the general reader. The fine introduction and prefaces provide added assistance to those who, starting here, will doubtlessly want to continue ex ploring poetry. Highly recommended. BOMC selection.-- Frank J.

    "excerpt": "<b>ROBERT FROST (1875-1963)</b>\n<p>Born in San Francisco, Frost moved to New England ten years later upon the death of his father, and in effect remained there the rest of his life, becoming the New Englander par excellence of his age. Yet his early life was not notably successful. Twice interrupted in attempts to secure a college degree, he farmed for a while in New Hampshire, worked as a mill hand, a schoolteacher, a newspaperman. His first poem was published in 1894; but during the next twenty years his work was consistently rejected by American editors.</p>\n<p>Finally, discouraged but still determined, Frost went to England in 1912, and there won the support of influential poets and critics, including Ezra Pound. His first two books, <b>A Boy's Will</b> (1913) and <b>North of Boston</b> (1914), were published in London. In 1915 he returned to America. Thereafter his success was unquestioned: he won many honors, including four Pulitzer Prizes for poetry, and became not only the most popular serious poet in the country but one of the most generally respected among fellow writers. Frost's poetic practice was based on what he called \"sentence sounds,\" the natural tones and rhythms of speech cast loosely against standard poetic forms. Conventional as it may seem today, it was a new departure in its time, making Frost a distinctly modern poet. Similarly his combination of Emersonian spiritual aspiration with back-country Yankee pragmatism placed him squarely among his contemporaries, to whom his metaphysically probing Iyrics and narratives, sometimes cynical or playful but often genuinely anguished, spoke with force. These factors, together with his superb poetic gift, make him dominant in the American tradition, a figure with whom younger poets, even the most rebellious, must come to terms.</p>\n<p><b>Complete Poems of Robert Frost</b>. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1949 ff.</p>\n<p>MENDING WALL</p>\n<p>Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>\nThat sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br>\nAnd spills the upper boulders in the sun;<br>\nAnd makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br>\nThe work of hunters is another thing:<br>\nI have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone,<br>\nBut they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<br>\nTo please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br>\nNo one has seen them made or heard them made,<br>\nBut at spring mending-time we find them there.<br>\nI let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br>\nAnd on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again.<br>\nWe keep the wall between us as we go.<br>\nTo each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br>\nAnd some are loaves and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell to make them balance:<br>\n'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'<br>\nWe wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br>\nOh, just another kind of outdoor game,<br>\nOne on a side. It comes to little more:<br>\nThere where it is we do not need the wall:<br>\nHe is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br>\nMy apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br>\nHe only says, 'Good fences make good neighbors.'<br>\nSpring is the mischief in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion in his head:<br>\n<i>'Why</i> do they make good neighbors? Isn't it Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br>\nBefore I built a wall I'd ask to know What I was walling in or walling out,<br>\nAnd to whom I was like to give offense.<br>\nSomething there is that doesn't love a wall That wants it down.' I could say 'E1ves' to him,<br>\nBut it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather He said it for himself. I see him there Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br>\nHe moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br>\nNot of woods only and the shade of trees.<br>\nHe will not go behind his father's saying,<br>\nAnd he likes having thought of it so well He says again, 'Good fences make good neighbors.'</p>\n<p class=\"null1\">CARL SANDBURG (1878-1967)</p>\n<p>The son of Swedish immigrants, Sandburg grew up in Galesburg, Ill., a railroad town, where he attended school until he was thirteen, then dropped out and wandered for years through the West and Midwest, working at varied jobs. He served in the Spanish-American War and for a while attended college. Finally he settled in Milwaukee, where he married, became a Socialist and a newspaperman, and began devoting himself seriously to poetry. In 1913 he moved to Chicago. Harriet Monroe, founder of <i>Poetry,</i> gave his work a prominent place in her magazine, where it attracted attention for its robust and Whitmanesque freedom. Two books, <b>Chicago Poetry</b> (1916) and <b>Cornhuskers</b> (1918), assured his reputation. During the twenties and thirties Sandburg toured widely, lecturing, reading his poems, singing and collecting folk songs, playing his guitar. His two collections, <b>The American Songbag</b> (1927) and <b>The New American Songbag</b> (1950), are important contributions to folklore. At the same time he became deeply interested in the life and achievement of Abraham Lincoln, and spent many years in producing a multi-volume biography. In addition his works include several first-rate books for children (the Rootabaga series), novels, autobiographies, screen plays, and much journalism. Sandburg's poetry was scorned during his middle and later life by the European-oriented critics of the time, and in part rightly so; he wrote too much and too facilely. But some of his early poems have a fresh vision and incantatory vigor that remain firm. In style, attitude, and temperament, he was closer to the young poets of today than most of them recognize.</p>\n<p><b>Complete Poems</b>.

The course he chose would have seemed paradoxical to many, but not to him. He studied law, entered the insurance business at Hartford, Conn., and spent a number of years working upward to an executive position and a life of affluence. Consequently his first book, <b>Harmonium</b> (1923), did not appear until he was forty-three years old; but then it made an immediate hit. Many of its poems became favorites: \"Hibiscus on the Sleeping Shores,\" \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The Emperor of Ice-Cream,\" \"Tea at the Palaz of Hoon,\" \"Sea Surface Full of Clouds,\" etc. They were as exotic as their titles; full of tropical imagery and unusual diction, armored in brilliant stylized rhetoric; but despite their ornamentation they dealt with disturbing themes, particularly man's attempt to find, or create, meaning in a universe from which the spiritual rationale had apparently departed. For Stevens, the way lay through aesthetic experience; yet he was never merely willing to substitute art for reality. The real world, he insisted, was the \"necessary angel\" who announced to imaginative man the plenitude of hie. As his books succeeded one another, perceptive readers saw that although the famous stylization of the early poems had moderated, the new work was more exact, better integrated, and more profoundly felt. Indeed some of Stevens's most moving poems, written in his last years, were not published until after his death, in a volume which also contains bis \"Adagia\", brilliant prose aphorisms and philosophical aperçus. No other poetry of the twentieth century has been more consistently, flawlessly individual; none has been more attractive; none has been harder to imitate. Hence the influence of Stevens on younger poets, though pervasive, has been indirect.</p>\n<p><b>The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens</b>. Knopf, 1954.<br>\n<b>Opus Posthumous</b>. Ed.

    "excerpt": "<p>I told the listeners that I was looking for stories. The stories had to be true, and they had to be short, but there would be no restrictions as to subject matter or style. What interested me most, I said, were stories that defied our expectations of the world, anecdotes that revealed the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives, in our family histories, in our minds and bodies, in our souls . . . I was hoping to put together an archive of facts, a museum of American reality.</p>\n<p>More than ever, I have come to appreciate how deeply and passionately most of us live within ourselves. Our attachments are ferocious. Our loves overwhelm us, define us, obliterate the boundaries between ourselves and others. —from the Prologue</p>\n<p>So there was Mr. Bernhauser yelling at us to get the hell out of his tree, and my father asked him what the problem was. Mr. Bernhauser took a deep breath and launched into a diatribe about thieving kids, breakers of rules, takers of fruit, and monsters in general. I guess my father had had enough, for the next thing he did was shout at Mr. Bernhauser and tell him to drop dead. Mr. Bernhauser stopped screaming, looked at my father, turned bright red, then purple, grabbed his chest, turned gray, and slowly folded to the ground. I thought my father was God. That he could yell at a miserable old man and make him die on command was beyond my comprehension. —Robert Winnie Bonners Ferry, Idaho</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p>A truly captivating collection of 180 real stories written by NPR radio listeners&#151;stories that, in editor Paul Auster's words, defy \"our expectations about the world and reveal[ed] the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives.\" <P>Annotation &copy; Book News, Inc., Portland, OR</p><h3>Book Magazine</h3><p>Two years ago, on National Public Radio's \"Weekend All Things Considered,\" Auster introduced the National Story Project. In an attempt \"to put together an archive of facts, a museum of American reality,\" he welcomed anyone to submit a story, following two rules: it must be true and it must be short. This book collects 179 stories-Auster calls them \"reports from the frontlines of personal experience\"-picked from over 4,000 entries. There is the unassuming yet beautiful portrait of a summer afternoon in a 1960s Manhattan neighborhood; the story of a man given leave after fifteen years in prison to attend his grandmother's funeral; and a homeless woman's account of her living situation. There are impossible coincidences, eerie omens and visions, and tales of love and war and family and death. <BR> Ted Waitt <BR> <BR></p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>Famed author Paul Auster presents 180 of the \"true tales\" from National Public Radio's monthly National Story Project series. The vividly personal biographies come from men and women of every conceivable background and cover more than 40 U.S. states. The accounts are short but powerful; they include everything from amusing misunderstandings to heartbreakingly tragic moments. The result is nothing less than what Auster himself describes as \"an archive of facts, a museum of American reality.\"\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>From the Publisher</h4><p>“A powerful book, one in which strangers share with you their darkest secrets, their happiest memories, their fears, their regrets. To read these essays is to look into hearts, to see life from other viewpoints, to live vicariously.” —<i>The Boston Globe</i></p>\n<p>“Unforgettable testimonials of human resilience. Moving and amusing dispatches from across America.” —<i>Us Weekly</i> (starred review)</p>\n<p>“Human foibles and frailties, laughter and tears...We are all hearing—and telling—stories all the time, especially now, in these days when life itself seems so fragile and precious. But Paul Auster’s wonderful efforts, choosing these fine stories, have given us a timely and invaluable reminder of what it means to listen—to really listen—to America talking.” —<i>The Times-Picayune</i> (New Orleans)</p>\n<p>“Finally, a bathroom book worthy of Pulitzer consideration: the one-to-three-page stories gathered in this astonishing, addictive collection are absolute gems.” —<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</p>\n<p>“It is difficult to think of another book published this year, and probably any book to be published next year, that is so simple and so obvious, so excellent in intention and so elegant in its execution, and which displays such wisdom and such knowledge of human life in all its varieties. It is also difficult to think of a book that is so stark a reminder that human experience can be horrid and utterly unbelievable, and which therefore answers so precisely to our current needs and circumstances.”—<i>The Guardian</i> (UK)</p>\n<p>“As this collection ably proves, we all shape experience into stories, and Auster has done a storyteller’s job himself of grouping these pieces effectively. Highly recommended.” —<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</p>\n<p>“Like no other book I have read in years, this one restored my belief in Americans and the American experience.” —Philip Levine, <i>Ploughshares</i></p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From The Critics</h4>Two years ago, on National Public Radio's \"Weekend All Things Considered,\" Auster introduced the National Story Project. In an attempt \"to put together an archive of facts, a museum of American reality,\" he welcomed anyone to submit a story, following two rules: it must be true and it must be short. This book collects 179 stories-Auster calls them \"reports from the frontlines of personal experience\"-picked from over 4,000 entries. There is the unassuming yet beautiful portrait of a summer afternoon in a 1960s Manhattan neighborhood; the story of a man given leave after fifteen years in prison to attend his grandmother's funeral; and a homeless woman's account of her living situation. There are impossible coincidences, eerie omens and visions, and tales of love and war and family and death. <br>\n—Ted Waitt <br>\n <br>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>This is a moving collection of stories that realizes the audio format's best possibilities. Culled from a collaboration between novelist Auster (Leviathan) and National Public Radio's All Things Considered, these slices of the American experience are real-life tales from people all over the country on a range of subjects. Since Auster himself selected the stories, it's no surprise that they echo his own approach while reading them: comfortable and emotive, with dexterous use of the power of understatement. Auster's tone is engaging, if a bit mellow, but what comes across more than anything is his genuine concern for the stories themselves and his belief in their merits. He keeps his dramatization to a minimum in order to let those merits shine through, and the recording is sure to leave listeners alternately smiling, nostalgic or melancholic. Even if a particular piece doesn't strike a chord, listeners won't be disappointed for long, as one of the production's finer points is its variety. Each tale lasts only a few minutes, but many of the images linger much longer. And because the stories were originally intended for radio, this is one instance where the audio is preferred over the print version. Based on the Holt hardcover (Forecasts, June 4, 2001). (Sept.) Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>In 2001, when NPR asked Auster to become a regular storyteller on Weekend All Things Considered, he wasn't interested. Then his wife suggested that he ask people to send him their stories to read on the air, and a few months later the National Story Project with was born. From some 4000 stories, Auster has selected 179, grouping them in loose categories: animals, objects, families, slapstick, strangers, war, love, death, dreams, and meditations. All are short, all are true, and they can be sad, hilarious, or both at the same time. In the title piece, Robert Winnie's father tells someone to drop dead and he does! In another, a grandson who has made his grandmother furious hears his grandfather tell him, \"You are my revenge.\" Others tell of impossible coincidences, difficult lives, and wonderful comebacks. As this collection ably proves, we all shape experience into stories, and Auster has done a storyteller's job himself of grouping the pieces effectively. Highly recommended for public libraries. [Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 5/1/01.] Mary Paumier Jones, Westminster P.L., Westminster, CO Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>Adult/High School-Auster was on the verge of saying no to an offer to tell his own stories on the air when a chance remark by his wife changed the complexion and ultimately the direction of a National Public Radio project. She suggested that listeners be invited to make submissions. With that, the remarkable National Story Project was born. The rules were relatively simple; the stories had to be true and they had to be short. Four thousand people sent in their work. After just a few months, it became evident to Auster that too many good stories were coming in and that a book would be necessary to do justice to the project. He chose what he considered to be the best-179 pieces, written by individuals ranging in age from 20 to 90, from all walks of life, and touching on everything from the amazing to the poignant. Readers will turn pages to see if the next story is just as memorable as the one before, and it is. This is a wonderful book about some incredible people, to enjoy and to share with others.-Peggy Bercher, Fairfax County Public Library, VA Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>A collection of vignettes from the American stew pot, written for broadcast on National Public Radio by men and women from every racial, cultural, and economic stratum. Auster, who proposed the National Story Project in 1999 and has been reading the results on NPR ever since, has received more than 4,000 submissions since the project began. He culled 179 of them for this volume, few more than two or three pages long, some as brief as half a page. Placing no limits on subject matter, Auster asked his listeners only for anecdotes that \"revealed the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives.\" What he got were tales ranging from spectral apparitions in the bedroom to painful custody trials, with a preponderant emphasis on childhood memories. The collection he shaped from this material encompasses the comic and the tragic, the absurd and the surreal, the mundane and the ethereal. The title story, for instance, recounts a bizarre incident from the writer's youth, when his father in a burst of justifiable irritation told a cranky neighbor to \"drop dead\"-and the neighbor did. \"The Chicken,\" which opens the collection, is a provocative six-sentence tale about a bird's adventure on the streets of Portland, Oregon. The volume is divided somewhat arbitrarily into 10 chapters, beginning with \"Animals\" and concluding with \"Meditations\"; \"War,\" \"Death,\" \"Love,\" and \"Slapstick\" fall in between. The prose can be awkward, pretentious, or occasionally elegant, but for the most part it's simple and direct. \"A Shot in the Light,\" for instance, relates the story of a man who was shot four times by a stranded motorist he had befriended. Victim and shooter survive, and the piece shows forgivenesson both sides, but the author makes no attempt to relate the incident to larger religious or political themes. Bedside fodder for general readers and a bonanza for fiction writers looking for core stories to launch a novel.

With its streamlined and student-friendly instructional text, and its ongoing commitment to showcasing the most engaging and diverse literary works publishing right now, <i>Approaching Literature</i> is built from the ground up with today's students in mind.</p>",

    "overview": "A best-selling anthology since its first edition, this premier survey of American literature has influenced the manner in which the American literary canon is taught in classrooms across the nation. In response to readers' requests, the editors of the <i>Heath Anthology</i> continue to develop and reinforce its greatest strengths: diverse reading selections and strong ancillaries. With the assistance of more than 200 contributing editors all specialists in particular eras and writers the editors have updated biographical and critical information, as well as added new works of interest to both instructors and students.<br>\n<br>\n<p>The Fourth Edition features writers and selections that highlight the divergent communities and diverse voices constituting the United States, both past and present. Volume 1 takes students from Native American oral literatures up to 1865, including Whitman and Dickinson. Volume 2 (which can be packaged with a free supplement of Whitman and Dickinson works) opens with African American folk tales and regional writers, and includes new sections on the Beat Movement and the Vietnam Conflict.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-length texts continue to be integrated throughout the anthology, including <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> in Vol. 1 and <i>The Awakening</i> in Vol. 2.</li>\n<li>The textbook web site complements both volumes of the text through a searchable, multimedia timeline with literary, historical, and cultural information; author profile pages; links to other sites for further research; and an online version of the Instructor's Guide.</li>\n<li>The Southern literature section includes two short stories by William Faulkner, Dry September and Barn Burning, and an essay by H.L. Mencken, TheSahara of the Bozarts. Coverage of border literature includes the work of novelist María Amparo Ruíz de Burton. In addition, gay and lesbian writers such as Dorothy Allison, James Merrill, and Richard Rodriguez are featured throughout.</li>\n</ul>",

This hefty tome features many significant essays, poems, and stories not readily available to all scholars that are drawn from African American journals of the period, including Opportunity, Crisis, and Fire! In his introduction, Lewis carefully explores tension within this arts and letters movement. The collected excerpts of writers like Cullen, Hurston, Hughes, McKay, DuBois, and Wright represent a balance between those Renaissance supporters and writers who ``saw the small cracks in the wall of racism that could, they anticipated, be widened through the production of exemplary racial images'' and those who ``saw art not as politics by other means--civil rights between covers or from a stage or an easel.''

Adding to the importance of the volume are several selections from rare and little-known texts that have been translated into English for the first time.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The compilers, scholars who have studied and written about the Latino population in the United States, have put together an anthology of literary works dealing with the panorama of Latino writings in the United States. The selections range widely, from Cabeza de Vaca's 1542 description of the South to recent excerpts from Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Mexican American authors. The collection is primarily literary though it does include some historical, autobiographical, and essay excerpts. It offers what would be expected in this type of anthology, with an occasional surprise, such as an excerpt from John Rechy's novel City of Night.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From the Publisher</h4>\"Anthologies of Latino literature abound, and rightly so, but most focus on contemporary authors. Augenbraum and Olmos dig deeper, tracing the roots of this vibrant literary tradition all the way back to the mid-sixteenth century. They have selected strikingly effective works of history, memoirs, letters, essays, poetry, drama, and fiction, including texts translated into English for the first time, creating a broad range of voices and perspectives. The volume begins with Alva Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Account, a chronicle of a disastrous 1527 expedition in the Southwest that is emblematic of all encounters between Spanish conquistadores and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This powerful piece serves as the anthology's overture, and establishes Latino literature's key cultural and political themes. Other compelling and enlightening offerings include works by William Carlos Williams, a poet whose Puerto Rican heritage has rarely been considered integral to his poetic innovations; novelist John Rechy; Cleofas Jaramillo, a descendent of hispano pioneers; and a host of remarkable Latino writers prominent in decades past but overlooked in recent compilations.\" Booklist, ALA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>The compilers, scholars who have studied and written about the Latino population in the United States, have put together an anthology of literary works dealing with the panorama of Latino writings in the United States. The selections range widely, from Cabeza de Vaca's 1542 description of the South to recent excerpts from Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Mexican American authors. The collection is primarily literary though it does include some historical, autobiographical, and essay excerpts. It offers what would be expected in this type of anthology, with an occasional surprise, such as an excerpt from John Rechy's novel City of Night. Readers will be primarily college and university students, but this will also be of value to smaller public libraries with limited Latino collections.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>No pleasures are more aesthetic than poetry and nature, so it is only natural that the two should unite. Editor Dungy here merges the worlds in a satisfying compilation that features over 100 poems by 93 African American poets, including celebrated writers June Jordan and Yusef Komunyakaa as well as newer artists like Remica L. Bingham and Indigo Moor. The collection, which is assembled in cycles that beg \"Nature, Be with Us,\" recognizes \"Pest, People Too,\" and recalls \"What the Land Remembers,\" explores a multitude of themes that incorporate the beauty, transformation, and unpredictability of Earth's elements. Though the collection moves away from political and protest poetry, readers will likely appreciate \"Disasters, Natural and Other,\" as the section draws from familiar incidents. James A. Emanuel's \"Emmett Till\" paints a haunting yet wondrous fantasy of his spirit, while Douglas Kearney's historical \"Floodsong 2: Water Moccasin's Spiritual\" has contemporary relevance following Hurricane Katrina. VERDICT Expanding the realm of traditional nature poetry and African American writings, this work will appeal to readers of both genres.—Ashanti White, Univ. of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<p>'Few cities,' writes Phillip Lopate in his introduction to this historic anthology, 'have inspired as much great writing as New York.'

    "excerpt": "<b>Chapter One: Washington Irving</b>\n<p><i>Washington Irving (1783-1859), America's first successful man of letters, now known primarily for his Hudson Valley tales \"Rip Van Winkle\" and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\" made his initial splash at age twenty-six with a comic, mock-learned, rambling volume, whose full title</i>, A History of New York From the Beginnings of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, <i>indicates the tongue-in-cheek, mythological manner in which Irving clothed his account of his native city's roots. The book pretended to have been written by an aged, bitter codger of Dutch extraction, Diedrich Knickerbocker -- in short, one of history's \"losers.\" Thus began the whole \"Knickerbocker\" tradition, connecting that pseudonym with the city's local legends. Though A History of New York certainly has passages of farce and satire, Irving (who did considerable research) often followed historical events fairly closely. In any case, this first published history of the city attempted to provide the amnesiac, hustling, nineteenth-century port with a founding myth and a past. Its ironic, disenchanted voice set the tone for much New York literature to come.</i></p>\n<p>From <i>A History of New York</i></p>\n<p>The island of Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan, having been discovered, as was related in the last chapter; and being unanimously pronounced by the discoverers, the fairest spot in the known world, whereon to build a city, that should surpass all the emporiums of Europe, they immediately returned to Communipaw with the pleasing intelligence. Upon this a considerable colony was forthwith fitted out, who after a prosperous voyage of half an hour,arrived at Manna hata, and having previously purchased the land of the Indians, (a measure almost unparalleled in the annals of discovery and colonization) they settled upon the south-west point of the island, and fortified themselves strongly, by throwing up a mud battery, which they named FORT AMSTERDAM. A number of huts soon sprung up in the neighbourhood, to protect which, they made an enclosure of strong pallisadoes. A creek running from the East river, through what at present is called Whitehall street, and a little inlet from Hudson river to the bowling green formed the original boundaries; as though nature had kindly designated the cradle, in which the embryo of this renowned city was to be nestled. The woods on both sides of the creek were carefully cleared away, as well as from the space of ground now occupied by the bowling green. -- These precautions were taken to protect the fort from either the open attacks or insidious advances of its savage neighbours, who wandered in hordes about the forests and swamps that extended over those tracts of country, at present called broad way, Wall street, William street and Pearl street.</p>\n<p>No sooner was the colony once planted, than like a luxuriant vine, it took root and throve amazingly; for it would seem, that this thrice favoured island is like a munificent dung hill, where every thing finds kindly nourishment, and soon shoots up and expands to greatness. The thriving state of the settlement, and the astonishing encrease of houses, gradually awakened the leaders from a profound lethargy, into which they had fallen, after having built their mud fort. They began to think it was high time some plan should be devised, on which the encreasing town should be built; so taking pipe in mouth, and meeting in close divan, they forthwith fell into a profound deliberation on the subject.</p>\n<p>At the very outset of the business, an unexpected difference of opinion arose, and I mention it with regret, as being the first internal altercation on record among the new settlers. An ingenious plan was proposed by Mynheer Ten Broek to cut up and intersect the ground by means of canals; after the manner of the most admired cities in Holland; but to this Mynheer Hardenbroek was diametrically opposed; suggesting in place thereof, that they should run out docks and wharves, by means of piles driven into the bottom of the river, on which the town should be built -- By this means said he triumphantly, shall we rescue a considerable space of territory from these immense rivers, and build a city that shall rival Amsterdam, Venice, or any amphibious city in Europe. To this proposition, Ten Broek (or Ten breeches) replied, with a look of as much scorn as he could possibly assume. He cast the utmost censure upon the plan of his antagonist, as being preposterous, and against the very order of things, as he would leave to every true hollander. \"For what,\" said he, \"is a town without canals? -- it is like a body without veins and arteries, and must perish for want of a free circulation of the vital fluid\" -- Tough breeches, on the contrary, retorted with a sarcasm upon his antagonist, who was somewhat of an arid, dry boned habit of body; he remarked that as to the circulation of the blood being necessary to existence, Mynheer Ten breeches was a living contradiction to his own assertion; for every body knew there had not a drop of blood circulated through his wind dried carcass for good ten years, and yet there was not a greater busy body in the whole colony. Personalities have seldom much effect in making converts in argument -- nor have I ever seen a man convinced of error, by being convicted of deformity. At least such was not the case at present. Ten Breeches was very acrimonious in reply, and Tough Breeches, who was a sturdy little man, and never gave up the last word, rejoined with encreasing spirit -- Ten Breeches had the advantage of the greatest volubility, but Tough Breeches had that invaluable coat of mail in argument called obstinacy -- Ten Breeches had, therefore, the most mettle, but Tough Breeches the best bottom -- so that though Ten Breeches made a dreadful clattering about his ears, and battered and belaboured him with hard words and sound arguments, yet Tough Breeches hung on most resolutely to the last. They parted therefore, as is usual in all arguments where both parties are in the right, without coming to any conclusion -- but they hated each other most heartily forever after, and a similar breach with that between the houses of Capulet and Montague, had well nigh ensued between the families of Ten Breeches and Tough Breeches.</p>\n<p>I would not fatigue my reader with these dull matters of fact, but that my duty as a faithful historian, requires that I should be particular -- and in truth, as I am now treating of the critical period, when our city, like a young twig, first received the twists and turns, that have since contributed to give it the present picturesque irregularity for which it is celebrated, I cannot be too minute in detailing their first causes.</p>\n<p>After the unhappy altercation I have just mentioned, I do not find that any thing further was said on the subject, worthy of being recorded. The council, consisting of the largest and oldest heads in the community, met regularly once a week, to ponder on this momentous subject. -- But either they were deterred by the war of words they had witnessed, or they were naturally averse to the exercise of the tongue, and the consequent exercise of the brains -- certain it is, the most profound silence was maintained -- the question as usual lay on the table -- the members quietly smoked their pipes, making but few laws, without ever enforcing any, and in the mean time the affairs of the settlement went on -- as it pleased God.</p>\n<p>As most of the council were but little skilled in the mystery of combining pot hooks and hangers, they determined most judiciously not to puzzle either themselves or posterity, with voluminous records. The secretary however, kept the minutes of each meeting with tolerable precision, in a large vellum folio, fastened with massy brass clasps, with a sight of which I have been politely favoured by my highly respected friends, the Goelets, who have this invaluable relique, at present in their possession. On perusal, however, I do not find much information -- The journal of each meeting consists but of two lines, stating in dutch, that, \"the council sat this day, and smoked twelve pipes, on the affairs of the colony.\" -- By which it appears that the first settlers did not regulate their time by hours, but pipes, in the same manner as they measure distances in Holland at this very time; an admirably exact measurement, as a pipe in the mouth of a genuine dutchman is never liable to those accidents and irregularities, that are continually putting our clocks out of order.</p>\n<p>In this manner did the profound council of NEW AMSTERDAM smoke, and doze, and ponder, from week to week, month to month, and year to year, in what manner they should construct their infant settlement -- mean while, the town took care of itself, and like a sturdy brat which is suffered to run about wild, unshackled by clouts and bandages, and other abominations by which your notable nurses and sage old women cripple and disfigure the children of men, encreased so rapidly in strength and magnitude, that before the honest burgomasters had determined upon a plan, it was too late to put it in execution -- whereupon they wisely abandoned the subject altogether.</p>\n<p>Grievous, and very much to be commiserated, is the task of the feeling historian, who writes the history of his native land. If it falls to his lot to be the sad recorder of calamity or crime, the mournful page is watered with his tears -- nor can he recal the most prosperous and blissful eras, without a melancholy sigh at the reflection, that they have passed away forever! I know not whether it be owing to an immoderate love for the simplicity of former times, or to a certain tenderness of heart, natural to a sentimental historian; but I candidly confess, I cannot look back on the halcyon days of the city, which I now describe, without a deep dejection of the spirits. With faultering hand I withdraw the curtain of oblivion, which veils the modest merits of our venerable dutch ancestors, and as their revered figures rise to my mental vision, humble myself before the mighty shades.</p>\n<p>Such too are my feelings when I revisit the family mansion of the Knickerbockers and spend a lonely hour in the attic chamber, where hang the portraits of my forefathers, shrowded in dust like the forms they represent. With pious reverence do I gaze on the countenances of those renowned burghers, who have preceded me in the steady march of existence -- whose sober and temperate blood now meanders through my veins, flowing slower and slower in its feeble conduits, until its lingering current shall soon be stopped forever!</p>\n<p>These, say I to myself, are but frail memorials of the mighty men, who flourished in the days of the patriarchs; but who, alas, have long since mouldered in that tomb, towards which my steps are insensibly and irresistibly hastening! As I pace the darkened chamber and lose myself in melancholy musings, the shadowy images around me, almost seem to steal once more into existence -- their countenances appear for an instant to assume the animation of life -- their eyes to pursue me in every movement! carried away by the delusion of fancy, I almost imagine myself surrounded by the shades of the departed, and holding sweet converse with the worthies of antiquity!</p>\n<p>-- Luckless Diedrich! born in a degenerate age -- abandoned to the buffettings of fortune -- a stranger and a weary pilgrim in thy native land; blest with no weeping wife, nor family of helpless children -- but doomed to wander neglected through those crowded streets, and elbowed by foreign upstarts from those fair abodes, where once thine ancestors held sovereign empire. Alas! alas! is then the dutch spirit forever extinct? The days of the patriarchs, have they fled forever? Return -- return sweet days of simplicity and ease -- dawn once more on the lovely island of Manna hata! -- Bear with me my worthy readers, bear with the weakness of my nature -- or rather let us sit down together, indulge the full flow of filial piety, and weep over the memories of our great great grand-fathers.</p>\n<p>Having thus gratified those feelings irresistibly awakened by the happy scenes I am describing, I return with more composure to my history.</p>\n<p>The town of New Amsterdam, being, as I before mentioned, left to its own course and the fostering care of providence, increased as rapidly in importance, as though it had been burthened with a dozen panniers full of those sage laws, which are usually heaped upon the backs of young cities -- in order to make them grow. The only measure that remains on record of the worthy council, was to build a chapel within the fort, which they dedicated to the great and good St. Nicholas, who immediately took the infant town of New Amsterdam under his peculiar patronage, and has ever since been, and I devoutly hope will ever be, the tutelar saint of this excellent city. I am moreover told, that there is a little legendary book somewhere extant, written in low dutch, which says that the image of this renowned saint, which whilome graced the bowsprit of the Goede Vrouw, was placed in front of this chapel; and the legend further treats of divers miracles wrought by the mighty pipe which the saint held in his mouth; a whiff of which was a sovereign cure for an indigestion, and consequently of great importance in this colony of huge feeders. But as, notwithstanding the most diligent search, I cannot lay my hands upon this little book, I entertain considerable doubt on the subject.</p>\n<p>This much is certain, that from the time of the building of this chapel, the town throve with tenfold prosperity, and soon became the metropolis of numerous settlements, and an extensive territory. The province extended on the north, to Fort Aurania or Orange, now known by the name of Albany, situated about 160 miles up the Mohegan or Hudson River. Indeed the province claimed quite to the river St. Lawrence; but this claim was not much insisted on at the time, as the country beyond Fort Aurania was a perfect wilderness, reported to be inhabited by cannibals, and termed Terra Incognita. Various accounts were given of the people of these unknown parts; by some they are described as being of the race of the <i>Acephali,</i> such as Herodotus describes, who have no heads, and carry their eyes in their bellies. Others affirm they were of that race whom father Charlevoix mentions, as having but one leg; adding gravely, that they were exceedingly alert in running. But the most satisfactory account is that given by the reverend Hans Megapolensis, a missionary in these parts, who, in a letter still extant, declares them to be the Mohagues or Mohawks; a nation, according to his description, very loose in their morals, but withal most rare wags. \"For,\" says he, \"if theye can get to bedd with another mans wife, theye thinke it a piece of wit.\" This excellent old gentleman gives moreover very important additional information, about this country of monsters; for he observes, \"theye have plenty of tortoises here, and within land, from two and three to four feet long; some with two heads, very mischievous and addicted to biting.\"</p>\n<p>Copyright © 1998 by Literary Classics of the United States, Inc.<br>\n<br>\n </p>",

    "overview": "<p>Award-winning poet David Wagoner and renowned editor David Lehman present the twenty-second edition of the <i>Best American Poetry</i> series—\"a ‘best’ anthology that really lives up to its title\" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>).</p>\n<p>Eagerly anticipated by scholars, students, readers, and poets alike, Scribner’s <i>Best American Poetry</i> series has achieved brand-name status in the literary world, serving as a yearly guide to who’s who in American poetry. Known for his marvelous narrative skill and humane wit, David Wagoner is one of the few poets of his generation to win the universal admiration of his peers. Working in conjunction with series editor David Lehman, Wagoner brings his refreshing eye to this year’s anthology. With new work by established poets, such as Billy Collins, Denise Duhamel, Mark Doty, and Bob Hicok, <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i> also features some of tomorrow’s leading luminaries. Readers of all ages and backgrounds will treasure this illuminating collection of modern American verse.</p>\n<p>With its high-profile editorship and its generous embrace of American poetry in all its exuberant variety, the <i>Best American Poetry</i> series continues to be, as Robert Pinsky says, \"as good a comprehensive overview of contemporary poetry as there can be.\"</p>",
    "excerpt": "<br>\n<b><big>Foreword</big></b><br>\n<b><i>by David Lehman</i></b><br>\n<p>What is a poet? In his \"Defense of Poetry,\" Shelley writes, \"A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.\" The solitude and sweet darkness, the emphasis on the unseen, the nightingale as the image of the poet, the listeners entranced but bewildered: how romantic this formulation is -- and how well it fits its author. Matthew Arnold alters the metaphor but retains something of its tone when he calls Shelley \"a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain.\" Kierkegaard in <i>Either/Or</i> goes further than either Shelley or Arnold in accentuating the negative. In a passage I've long admired, Kierkegaard identifies the poet as one whose heart is full of anguish but whose lips transform all sighs and groans into beautiful music. Kierkegaard likens the fate of this \"unhappy\" individual to the cruel and unusual punishment meted out by the tyrant Phalaris, whose unfortunate victims, \"slowly roasted by a gentle fire\" in a huge copper bull, let out shrieks that turn into sweet melodies by the time they reach the tyrant's ears. The success of the poet, then, corresponds to the amount of agony endured. Readers clamor for more, for they are aware only of the music and not of the suffering that went into it. The critics, too, stand ready to applaud -- if, that is, the poet's work meets the requirements of the immutable \"laws of aesthetics.\" And here Kierkegaard's parable acquires an extra layer of irony, the better to convey his contempt for critics. \"Why, to be sure,\" he writes, \"a critic resembles a poet as one pea another, the only difference being that he has no anguish in his heart and no music on his lips.\" And therefore, Kierkegaard concludes with a flourish, sooner would he be a swineherd understood by the swine than a poet misunderstood by men.</p>\n<p>Kierkegaard's argument proceeds by the logic of his similes -- the sweet music, the barbaric torture, the prosaic peas in the pod, the swineherd as an honorable profession -- and the abrupt tonal shift at the end from sarcasm to defiance. If, as Wallace Stevens asserted, \"poetry is almost incredibly one of the effects of analogy,\" here is a gorgeous example. The passage has the virtue, moreover, of raising questions about the occupational hazards that poets face and about their relation to a world of readers and reviewers.</p>\n<p>In one way, at least, Kierkegaard's parable is untrue to the experience of American poets, who rarely have to fend off legions of avid admirers. But the notion that the job of the critic is to find fault with the poetry -- that the aims of criticism and of poetry are opposed -- is still with us or, rather, has returned after a hiatus. It was once erroneously thought that devastating reviews caused John Keats's untimely death in his twenty-sixth year. Lord Byron in <i>Don Juan</i> had Keats and his reviewers in mind when he wrote, \"Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, / Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.\" In reality, however, it was not criticism but consumption that cut short Keats's life.1 Many of us delight in Oscar Wilde's witty paradoxes that blur the identities of artist and critic.2 The critical essays of T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden are continuous with their poems and teach us that criticism is a matter not of enforcing the \"laws of aesthetics\" or meting out sentences as a judge might pronounce them in court. Rather, the poet as critic engages with works of literature and enriches our understanding and enjoyment of them. Yet today more than a few commentators seem intent on punishing the authors they review. It has grown into a phenomenon. In the March 2009 issue of <i>Poetry</i>, the critic Jason Guriel defends \"negativity\" as \"the poetry reviewer's natural posture, the default position she assumes before scanning a single line.\" The title of Guriel's piece sums it up: \"Going Negative.\"</p>\n<p>The romantic image of the poet as a vulnerable personage in a hostile universe has not gone out of currency. The poet is doomed to go unrecognized and to pay dearly for his music-making powers. The gift of poetry comes not as an unalloyed blessing but as the incidental virtue of a defect or as compensation for a loss, an injury, an ailment, a deficiency. Edmund Wilson coined the phrase that readily comes to mind for this dynamic of compensatory balance: \"the wound and the bow.\" Before it served Wilson as the title of a collection of his essays (1941), the phrase headed his study of the myth of Philoctetes, which the critic took as paradigmatic of the artist's situation. Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles treated the myth in plays; the <i>Philoctetes</i> of Sophocles survives. The hero, who excels even Odysseus at archery, possesses the invincible bow that once belonged to Hercules. Philoctetes joins the Greeks in their assault on Troy but is bitten by a poisonous snake, and the suppurating wound emits so foul an odor that his comrades-in-arms abandon him on the island of Lemnos. There he is stranded for ten miserable years. But when a Trojan prophet is forced to reveal that the Greeks will fail to conquer Troy without the unerring bow of Philoctetes, a platoon is dispatched to reenlist the archer -- who is understandably reluctant to return to the fray -- and to recover his arms by any means necessary. In Sophocles, Philoctetes is cured at Troy. He goes on to kill Paris, the Trojan prince whose abduction of Helen precipitated the epic conflict, and he becomes one of the heroes of the Greek victory. One lesson, according to Wilson, is that \"genius and disease, like strength and mutilation, may be inextricably bound up together.\" In the most speculative and provocative sentence in the essay, Wilson ventures that \"somewhere even in the fortunate Sophocles there had been a sick and raving Philoctetes.\"</p>\n<blockquote><small>1. Not that the critics were blameless. The anonymous reviewer writing for <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i> (August 1818) called Keats's <i>Endymion</i> \"imperturbable driveling idiocy.\" Endymion was supposed to be \"a Greek shepherd loved by a Grecian goddess,\" but in Keats's hands, he was \"merely a young Cockney rhymester.\"</small></blockquote>\n<blockquote><small>2. In <i>The Critic as Artist</i>, Wilde radically revises Matthew Arnold on the function of criticism. According to Arnold, the endeavor is \"to see the object as in itself it really is.\" According to Wilde, the aim is \"to see the object as in itself it really is not.\"</small></blockquote>\n<p>W. H. Auden's early prose poem, \"Letter to a Wound\" (1931), is a powerful modern statement of the theme: \"You are so quiet these days that I get quite nervous, remove the dressing. I am safe, you are still there.\" Addressing the wound as \"you\" is not merely a grammatical convenience but the vehicle of a linguistic transformation; the ailment becomes an active, willful muse and companion -- albeit one whose traits include \"insane jealousy,\" \"bad manners,\" and a \"passion for spoiling things.\" The letter writer has learned to live with his incurable condition as with a secret partner, an illicit lover. They have even gone through a \"honeymoon stage\" together. \"Thanks to you,\" Auden writes, \"I have come to see a profound significance in relations I never dreamt of considering before, an old lady's affection for a small boy, the Waterhouses and their retriever, the curious bond between Offal and Snig, the partners in the hardware shop in the front.\" The wound is not named, though we read of a visit to a surgeon, who begins a sentence, \"I'm afraid,\" and need not add a word. The particular virtue of this epistolary prose poem is that \"I\" and \"you,\" a pair of pronouns, are raised to the level of a universal duality and are therefore greater than any specific duality that seems appropriate -- whether \"artist\" and \"wound,\" or \"self\" and \"soul,\" or \"ego\" and \"id,\" or \"lover\" and \"beloved.\"</p>\n<p>It is difficult not to fall under the spell of Wilson's wound and bow or of the corresponding myth in the Hebraic tradition. In the thirty-second chapter of Genesis, Jacob -- who twice in the past had got the better of his brother Esau, both times by cunning or deceit -- must wrestle with \"a man\" who will not reveal his name and who must flee the scene at daybreak. The struggle takes place on the eve of his first encounter with Esau after many years, in the deep darkness of the night, and it is physical combat of a kind not associated with Jacob. When he fights the angel to a standstill, he receives a blessing and a new name, Israel (because he has \"contended with God and men and has prevailed\"). But he has also suffered a wound \"in the hollow of his thigh\" that causes him to limp thereafter. The story is rich and mysterious in inverse proportion to its length: nine biblical verses. Though each is said to be a source of power, the Hebrew blessing bestowed on Jacob is utterly different from the Greek bow. Yet at bottom we find the familiar dialectic of compensation.</p>\n<p>Such myths may console us. The logic of Emerson's essay \"Compensation\" has saved my spirits on many a dismal afternoon. \"The sure years reveal the deep emotional force that underlies all facts,\" Emerson writes. \"The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character.\" It is to Emerson's essay that I turn when I need to tamp down the impulses of resentment or envy and reconcile myself to realities. There is wisdom here and truth, a counterargument if not exactly a solution to the problem of evil that Gerard Manley Hopkins stated summarily: \"Why do sinners' ways prosper? And why must / Disappointment all I endeavor end?\"</p>\n<p>There is also, however, a danger in the intimate association of genius and illness, especially mental illness, especially at a time when many of us engaged in the discourse of poetry come into contact with ever-increasing numbers of impressionable young people who want to study creative writing. The romantic conception of the poet can lead too easily to self-pity or worse, the glorification of madness and the idealization of the self-inflicted wound. We need to remember that poetry springs from joy as often as from sorrow: the impulse to praise is as strong as the impulse to mourn. Lionel Trilling's essay \"Art and Neurosis\" is a vital corrective to the tendency to assent too readily to propositions obscuring the differences between genius and madness. Trilling accepts the premise that all of us, including \"the fortunate Sophocles,\" are ill; we are all neurotic. In that case, it is not the primal hurt but the ability to rise above it that distinguishes the artist. Poetry is not a matter of divine madness but the product of labor and conscious mind. \"Nothing is so characteristic of the artist as his power of shaping his work, of subjugating his raw material, however aberrant it be from what we call normality,\" Trilling writes. \"What marks the artist is his power to shape the material of pain we all have.\"</p>\n<p>My favorite sentence in Kierkegaard's parable is the one in which poets and critics are considered identical except that the latter lack the very qualities -- the anguish in the heart and the music on the lips -- that are definitive of the poet. For many years I resisted Kierkegaard's \"either/ or\" logic. I felt that there needn't be a structural enmity between poetry and criticism. Now I wonder.</p>\n<p>The characteristic badness of literary criticism in the 1980s was that it was heavily driven by theory and saddled with an unlovely vocabulary. T. S. Eliot, in \"The Function of Criticism\" (1923), says he \"presumes\" that \"no exponent of criticism\" has \"ever made the preposterous assumption that criticism is an autotelic activity\" -- that is, an activity to be undertaken as an end in itself without connection to a work of literature. Eliot did not figure on post-structuralism and the critic's declaration of independence from the text. If you wanted criticism \"constantly to be confronted with examples of poetry,\" as R. P. Blackmur recommends in \"A Critic's Job of Work,\" you were in for a bad time in the 1980s. The academic critics' disregard of contemporary poetry paralleled the rise of creative writing as a field of study and, partly in consequence, the writing of poetry did not suffer, though from time to time you would hear the tired refrain that poetry -- like God, the novel as a form, and the author altogether -- had died. This shibboleth itself has not perished. <i>Newsweek</i> reports that, despite \"anecdotal evidence that interest in poetry is on the rise,\" statistics show a decline. \"Is an art form dying?\" the magazine asks.3 Donald Hall wrote the definitive response to these premature death notices, \"Death to the Death of Poetry,\" which served as the introduction to <i>The Best American Poetry 1989</i>. Hall's assertion remains valid: \"American poetry survives; it even prevails.\"</p>\n<blockquote><small>3. Marc Bain, \"The End of Verse?\" <i>Newsweek</i>, March 25, 2009.</small></blockquote>\n<p>Poetry criticism at its worst today is mean in spirit and spiteful in intent, as if determined to inflict the wound that will spur the artist to new heights if it does not cripple him or her. Somewhere along the line, the notion took hold that poets were reluctant to write honestly about their peers. But in the absence of critics who are not themselves poets, surely the antidote is not to encourage the habit of rejection without explanation, denunciation without a reasoned argument, and a slam of the gavel in high dudgeon as if a poem were a felony. Hostile criticism, criticism by insult, may have entertainment value, but animus does not guarantee honesty. As one who knows from firsthand experience what a book reviewer faces when writing on deadline, I can tell the real thing when I see it, and the hysterical over-the-top attack is as often as not the product of a pose. Every critic knows it is easier (and more fun) to write a ruthless review rather than a measured one. As a reviewer, you're not human if you don't give vent to your outrage once or twice -- if only to get the impulse out of you. If you have too good a time writing hostile reviews, you'll injure not only your sensibility but your soul. Frank O'Hara felt he had no responsibility to respond to a bad poem. It'll \"slip into oblivion without my help,\" he would say.</p>\n<p>William Logan typifies the bilious reviewer of our day. He has attacked, viciously, a great many American poets; I, too, have been the object of his scorn. Logan is the critic as O'Hara defined the species: \"the assassin of my orchards.\" You can rely on him to go for the most wounding gesture. Michael Palmer writes a \"Baudelaire Series\" of poems, for example, and Logan comments, \"Baudelaire would have eaten Mr. Palmer for breakfast, with salt.\" The poems of Australian poet Les Murray seem \"badly translated out of Old Church Slavonic with only a Russian phrase book at hand.\" Reviewing a book by Adrienne Rich is a task that Logan feels he could almost undertake in his sleep. Reading C. K. Williams is \"like watching a dog eat its own vomit.\"</p>\n<p>For many years, Logan reserved his barbs for the poets of our time. More recently he has sneered at Emily Dickinson (\"a bloodless recluse\") and condescended to Emerson (\"a mediocre poet\"). And still the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> turned to Logan to review the new edition of Frank O'Hara's <i>Selected Poems</i> last summer. Logan's piece began with the observation that O'Hara's death at the age of forty in a freak accident was a \"good career move.\" This is not a particularly original phrase, but in O'Hara's case it is doubly unkind, giving the false impression that he died by his own hand.</p>\n<p>Logan's treatment of Langdon Hammer's Library of America edition of Hart Crane's poetry and prose -- which ran in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> in January 2007 -- provoked among many readers the feeling that here he had gone too far. The piece dwelled on Crane's \"sexual appetites,\" which \"were voracious and involved far too many sailors,\" and included a flip dismissal of Crane's poem \"Chaplinesque\" (a \"dreadful mess\"). The review triggered off a spate of letters that the Times duly printed. Rosanna Warren summed up what many felt: \"Snide biographical snippets about homosexuality and alcoholism are not literary criticism, nor are poems illuminated by sarcastic bons mots ('a Myth of America conceived by Tiffany and executed by Disney,' 'like being stuck in a mawkish medley from <i>Show Boat</i> and <i>Oklahoma!</i>'). Crane's revelatory weaknesses as well as his, yes, genius, deserved a more responsible accounting.\"</p>\n<p>Wounded by the outcry, Logan wrote a lengthy defense of himself and his procedures in the October 2008 issue of <i>Poetry</i>. More letters to the editor followed: three pages of them in the December 2008 issue, along with a concluding comment by Logan longer than the combined efforts of the correspondents. For one who routinely seeks to give offense, Logan turns out to be thin-skinned. In the end he falls back on the argument that it is fruitless to argue in matters of taste. \"The problem with taste is, yours is right and everyone else's is wrong,\" Logan writes. Bosh. The real problem is that Logan confuses taste with bias. Using the Romantic poets as an example, he writes: \"You can't stand that ditherer Coleridge, she can't stand that whiner Keats, I can't stand that dry fussbudget Wordsworth, and we all hate Shelley.\" Only someone for whom poets are merely names, abstractions that never had a flesh-and-blood existence, could so gleefully reduce these poets to those epithets. But when Logan returns to \"Chaplinesque,\" Hart Crane's \"hapless little\" poem (and how that unnecessary \"little\" rankles), he gives the game away.</p>\n<p>Here is \"Chaplinesque\":</p>\n<blockquote>We make our meek adjustments,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Contented with such random consolations</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As the wind deposits</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In slithered and too ample pockets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For we can still love the world, who find</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A famished kitten on the step, and know</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Recesses for it from the fury of the street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Or warm torn elbow coverts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We will sidestep, and to the final smirk</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Facing the dull squint with what innocence</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And what surprise!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And yet these fine collapses are not lies</blockquote>\n<blockquote>More than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We can evade you, and all else but the heart:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>What blame to us if the heart live on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The game enforces smirks; but we have seen</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The moon in lonely alleys make</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A grail of laughter of an empty ash can,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And through all sound of gaiety and quest</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Have heard a kitten in the wilderness.</blockquote>\n<p>To Logan the poem's concluding lines are self-evidently \"embarrassing,\" an adjective he uses twice without substantiation. In the three separate pieces in which Logan brings up the poem, he lazily repeats the same charges, uses the same modifiers: the penultimate stanza of \"Chaplinesque\" is \"hapless and tone deaf,\" the ending is \"schmaltz,\" and the poem as a whole is evidence that the poet was \"star-struck\" by Charlie Chaplin, whose movies inspired Crane.</p>\n<p>Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but a professional critic has the responsibility to develop opinions, not just to state them. Rather than make the effort to see how Crane's poem works as a response to Chaplin's film <i>The Kid</i>, Logan ridicules the \"star-struck\" poet, likening Chaplin then to Angelina Jolie now, a comparison of dubious value that manages to insult everyone including Chaplin, Crane, Angelina Jolie, and the \"seventy-seven American poets\" who, Logan says in his patented blend of self-regard and snarky wit, have written odes to Jolie because Logan wrote that Crane met Chaplin after writing \"Chaplinesque.\"</p>\n<p>I do not claim to comprehend \"Chaplinesque\" perfectly, but I believe that the lover of poetry will recognize the genius in this poem before any irritable reaching after paraphrase. Crane's repeated use of the homonym for his first name -- \"We can evade you, and all else but the heart: What blame to us if the heart live on\" -- seems to me, for example, well worth pondering in the context of the lines' pronomial ambiguity. The poem's opening stanzas are so rich one wants to say them over and over, to speculate on the idea of the Chaplin persona as an image of the poet, of the \"famished kitten\" as an image of poetry, or to contemplate the remarkable sequence of \"smirk,\" \"thumb,\" and \"squint\" in the third stanza. The finger-in-the-eye slapstick comedy routine has never seemed so threatening, even if we can \"Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb / That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us.\" The poem's ending is particularly memorable. You may not make easy sense of that \"grail of laughter\" created by the moon out of a garbage can in a deserted alley. But this arresting image that fuses the sacred and the profane, sky and slum, will not soon depart from your consciousness. The key phrase here, \"a grail of laughter,\" is a great example of a poetic image that defies logical analysis, for we instinctively grasp it as a figure of the sublime, though we know that a grail cannot be \"of\" laughter in any conventional sense. The laughter is the \"sound of gaiety and quest,\" and \"we\" can see the miracle, behold the grail, because we have heard the cry of the alley cat, and we know that poetry is not simply a grand visionary quest but also something very precious and vulnerable, a kitten in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>The critic whose take on \"Chaplinesque\" I'd like to see is Christopher Ricks. Ricks begins his book <i>T. S. Eliot and Prejudice</i> with a reading of the most audacious poetic debut of the twentieth century. You might have thought that \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" would require the critic to digress from a consideration of prejudice, the focal point of Ricks's study of Eliot. Not so. Ricks quotes the uncanny stand-alone couplet that Eliot uses twice: \"In the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.\" What have scholars said about the lines? The Oxford don Helen Gardner hears \"high-pitched feminine voices\" that are absurdly inadequate to the \"giant art\" of Michelangelo. Grover Smith says he has \"no doubt\" the women are talking \"tediously and ignorantly.\" To Hugh Kenner, the women are \"trivial.\" John Crowe Ransom, discerning \"contempt\" in Eliot's voice, rephrases the couplet as a rhetorical question about the women: \"How could they have had any inkling of that glory which Michelangelo had put into his marbles and his paintings?\"</p>\n<p>Yet, as Ricks observes, nowhere does Eliot tell us how to react to these women entering and leaving the drawing room. He chooses \"talking\" to describe what they are doing when he could as easily have said \"prattling.\" He uses no adjective to denigrate the women, though at his disposal he had those I've already given (\"trivial,\" \"ignorant,\" \"tedious\") and more (\"shallow,\" \"affected,\" \"fashionable\"). Nor does Eliot praise the \"glory\" of Michelangelo's \"giant art\" by way of emphasizing the discrepancy between the women and the object of their conversation. It is a measure of Eliot's subtlety and skill that he disdains such modifiers as would bully a reader into the desired response. But Ricks's larger point is that even redoubtable critics are unaware of \"how much their sense of the lines is incited by prejudice.\"</p>\n<p>Ricks's treatment of Eliot illustrates how canny a close reader he is. It may remind us also of the pleasure to be had from such acts of critical acumen. And if, as Wordsworth insisted in the preface to the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, the giving of pleasure constitutes the poet's first obligation to the reader, may it not be reasonable to expect the critic of poetry to honor this same imperative? Yet what Wordsworth calls the \"grand elementary principle of pleasure\" is missing from discussions of contemporary poetry. Schadenfreude is a poor substitute. True delight accompanies edification when a lover of poetry shows us how to read a poem on its own terms, paying it the respect of careful attention, leaving aside the prejudices of the anathematist, the ideologue, the apostle of received opinion, or the bully on the block.</p>\n<p>It may just be that the most appealing alternative to the negativity of contemporary criticism is the selective inclusiveness of a dedicated editor. For thirty-six years David Wagoner edited <i>Poetry Northwest</i>. The value of a supportive editor is incalculable, and Wagoner was among the best. His editorial practice can be seen as an extension of his humane poetics. For more than a half century, he has written about ordinary lives and real landscapes with grace and emotional complexity. A master of the plain style, for whom clarity and directness are cardinal virtues, he is a poet of wisdom and wonder. In their unostentatious way, his poems remind us of what it means to be human. Although we set our sights on the heavens, what we see from the wrong end of the telescope may prove more vital, for it \"shows us just how little the gods see / if they look back.\" Yet like actors in a grand comedy we turn and change, turn and change, \"like young heavenly objects / endlessly reembodied\" with \"wardrobes as various / as the wonders of new stars.\" I am conflating quotations from two poems in Wagoner's latest collection, <i>A Map of the Night</i>, which appeared last year -- the year Wagoner spent reading for <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i>. He has selected poems from an unprecedented number of print or electronic journals: fifty-six. The poets explore subjects ranging from love and death to God, Freud, the beauty of the matriarchs in Genesis, the animals with which we share the planet, \"the land to the south of our neighbors to the north,\" the movies, and \"The Great American Poem.\" A number of the poets address crises in the body politic: the damaged Mississippi Gulf Coast (\"Liturgy\"), the assassination of Daniel Pearl (\"Forty\"), the massacre at Virginia Tech (\"Ringtone\"). We read about the prospect of a change in government (\"A Sea-Change\") and are confronted with \"A Democratic Vista\" and the assurance that \"Ultimately Justice Directs Them.\"</p>\n<p>The biggest political story of 2008, the campaign and election of Barack Obama as president of the United States, sparked great enthusiasm among American poets. No sooner had the election results come in than the speculation began as to whom the incoming administration would tap to read a poem at the inauguration. Only two previous presidents (Kennedy and Clinton) had incorporated a poem in the inaugural proceedings, but everyone was confident that Obama would renew this tradition and everyone was right. Elizabeth Alexander was entrusted with the task. But even after her name was disclosed, the print and broadcast media continued to run stories on the importance of poetry in the national discourse. Perusal of the poems written by U.S. presidents of the past revealed Lincoln to be our best presidential poet. Anecdotes surfaced on Theodore Roosevelt's admiration of Edwin Arlington Robinson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's recognition of Archibald MacLeish's talents as a speechwriter, librarian, and adviser at large. The Associated Press reporter Nancy Benac asked a number of poets to write -- and, where practicable, recite for the camera -- ceremonial poems written with Obama's inauguration in mind. Billy Collins, Yusef Komunyakaa, Alice Walker, Christopher Funkhouser, Amiri Baraka, cowboy poet Ted Newman, Julia Alvarez, Gary Soto, Bob Holman, and I composed poems for the occasion. The results are still accessible via the Internet.</p>\n<p>The Internet has multiplied the number of places in which a poem may appear. If it was difficult previously to cover American poetry, even with a company of skillful readers, it is now quite impossible. As David Wagoner notes in his introduction to this year's <i>Best American Poetry</i>, there are more venues for poetry than ever before. Web sites, zines, and blogs have enabled us to close up the lag between the composition and dissemination of any piece of writing. It remains to be seen how this technological advance will affect the nature of the writing itself, although the odds are that it will abet not only the tendency toward informality but also the impulse to buck it by emphasizing new and unusual forms: the abecedarius (or double abecedarius), the lipogram, the use of \"found forms\" such as the index of first lines in the back of a book of poems. Poems in such forms as these have turned up in recent and current volumes of <i>The Best American Poetry</i>, as have, to be sure, sonnets, sestinas, riddles, prose poems, a villanelle, a cento, a blues poem, a pantoum. The rediscovery of old forms and the fabrication of new ones is one notable tendency in contemporary poetry. A second is the growing appeal of the conversational style that David Kirby calls \"ultra talk\": a poem that sounds as natural as talk -- if we could script our talk. After observing that \"every revolution in poetry\" is at base \"a return to common speech,\" T. S. Eliot in \"The Music of Poetry\" (1942) goes on to give the rationale for this sort of \"talk poetry\": \"No poetry, of course, is ever exactly the same speech that the poet talks and hears: but it has to be in such a relation to the speech of his time that the listener or reader can say 'that is how I should talk if I could talk poetry.' \"</p>\n<p>In 2008, <i>The Best American Poetry</i> launched our blog, which seemed at first to be an indulgence, then a convenience, before we understood that it could function as a kind of magazine, the contents of which change daily and feature an ever-changing roster of contributing writers and columnists. We post poems and comments on poems but also news, links, photos, illustrations, and prose on any subject that engages the mind of a poet. There are certain recurring features. We like aphorisms (\"There are people who are too intelligent to become authors, but they do not become critics\": W. H. Auden) and brainteasers (\"Lives in winter, / Dies in summer, / And grows with its root upwards\").4 From time to time we have run contests. Mark Strand judged Gerald Greland the winner of the inaugural ode contest we posted a day or two after Barack Obama's electoral victory. Paul Violi judged Frank Osen the winner of the previous year's competition, in which contestants were asked to decipher an anagram and to write an acrostic poem based on the result. I am still marveling at the notion that, in contrast to the strict limitations of space in a print magazine, we can publish 365 poems in a calendar year. And we can do things like monitor the cultural markers on an acclaimed television show.</p>\n<blockquote><small>4. \"When a riddler, using the bold weapon of metaphor, forces us to contemplate an icicle as a plant, it is an imaginative coup; briefly, and in a small way, our sense of the structure of reality is shaken.\" Richard Wilbur, \"The Persistence of Riddles\" in <i>The Catbird's Song: Prose Pieces 1963-1995</i> (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1997), p. 44.</small></blockquote>\n<p>The spirit of Frank O'Hara hovered over the second season of the TV series <i>Mad Men</i> on AMC in 2008. In the first episode, ad man Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm) finds himself at a Midtown bar not far from where O'Hara loitered during his lunch hours when he worked as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art. On the barstool next to Draper sits a man with horn-rimmed glasses and curly hair reading O'Hara's <i>Meditations in an Emergency</i>. It is 1962. John F. Kennedy is president. Marilyn Monroe is still alive. Draper asks the man about the book. \"You probably wouldn't like it,\" he is told. But Don buys it, we see him reading it in his office, and as the episode concludes, he mails the book to person or persons unknown and, in a voice-over, recites the fourth and final part of O'Hara's poem \"Mayakovsky\" in <i>Meditations in an Emergency</i>. The unforgettable phrase \"the catastrophe of my personality\" occurs here. The charm of such ironic self-deprecation, which is part of O'Hara's character armor, extends to the voice-over. The last words in \"Mayakovsky\" imply a split in the speaker's personality: \"It may be the coldest day of / the year, what does he think of / that? I mean, what do I? And if I do, / perhaps I am myself again.\" The grammatical fact that, in a narrative, the same person can be either \"I\" or \"he\" turns into an apt metaphor for Don Draper, who bears someone else's name -- he switched identities (we learned in season one) with a fallen comrade in a skirmish during the Korean War.</p>\n<p><i>Meditations in an Emergency</i> returns as the title of the thirteenth and final episode in season two of <i>Mad Men</i>. Marilyn Monroe has died. It is October. President Kennedy is addressing the nation on TV. Virtually all the characters in the show are going through an emergency of one kind or another, while the country as a whole faces the grave emergency that was the Cuban Missile Crisis. Unlike radio, which has always been a congenial medium for poems and verse plays, TV and poetry have seemed as irreconcilable as dance and architecture. Not the least of Matthew Weiner's accomplishments is the brilliant way he has used O'Hara's poetry to govern the themes of a dramatic series on TV. Mad Men is a big hit, sales of Meditations in an Emergency continue to climb, and a new generation of readers has fallen in love with the poems of Frank O'Hara.</p>\n<p> Copyright © 2009 by David Lehman</p>",

It remains remarkable in its ability to present the African-American experience through poetry that speaks for itself without the distraction of artwork or the need to trumpet itself as being multicultural. This revised and updated edition has 21 new selections, representing 19 poets (9 of them women), added to the thematic sections of the original title. Now, readers can meet more contemporary writers such as Rita Dove, Maya Angelou, and Ishmael Reed as well as classic black poets like Countee Cullen, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Langston Hughes. An introduction puts the book in historical context and a foreword offers encouragement to a new generation of readers. Notes and biographies have been updated and added where appropriate and Andrews's spare but evocative line drawings still open each section. Because of the historical context of many of the poems, the book will be much in demand during Black History Month, but it should be used and treasured as part of the larger canon of literature to be enjoyed by all Americans at all times of the year. An indispensable addition to library collections.Carrie Schadle, New York Public Library\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<h1>Mental Floss: Scatterbrained</h1>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\">\n<b>By Virginia Editors of Mental Floss</b>  \n<h4 class=\"null1\">HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.</h4>\n<b>Copyright © 2006</b> <b>Virginia Editors of Mental Floss<br>\n All right reserved.</b><br>\n <b>ISBN: 0060882506</b> <br>\n \n<hr noshade size='1'>\n<p class=\"null2\">Chapter One</p>\n<p><b>01 Greece (the Country):</b><br>\n <i>The Only Facts You Need to Know</i></p>\n<p>Everyone knows the story of the marathon: Some Greek guy ran for about 20 miles from the city of Marathon to neighboring Athens, whereupon he gasped, \"<i>Nike</i>,\" and promptly died. (That wasn't an early form of product placement, just the Greek word for \"victory.\") You might not know, however, that at the first modern Olympics in 1896, the marathon distance was set at 24.85 miles (40 kilometers). So why is it 26.2 today? To please the King of England, of course! For the 1908 Olympics in London, the distance was lengthened to 26 miles so the course could go from Windsor Castle to White City Stadium and then lengthened another 385 yards so the race could finish right in front of Kind Edward VII's stadium box. Now you know whose name to curse when staggering those last miserable marathon steps.</p>\n<p>The first winner of the modern Olympic marathon, incidentally, was a Greek. Spyridon Louis, a postal worker (who trained, we imagine, by running away from ferocious dogs). He finished in 2:58:50.</p>\n<p>And you thought 99 bottles of beer on the wall was bad: The Greek national anthem, with its 158 stanzas, is the longest national anthemin the world.</p>\n<p>If you've ever found yourself legs akimbo, feet in stirrups, wondering why they call it a \"Pap\" smear: Greek-American George Papanicolaou created the test, which has helped reduce cervical cancer fatality rates by almost 50 percent since its introduction in the 1940s. (For some reason, \"Papanicolaou smear\" never caught on.)</p>\n<p><b>02 Means to an End:</b><br>\n <i>Unpleasant Execution Methods Throughout History<br>\n (In Reverse Order of Preference!)</i></p>\n<p><i><b>Ling Chi:</b></i> A slow, excruciating death, implemented a millennium ago by China's Song dynasty, <i>ling chi</i> (or \"slicing\") entails a piecemeal disassembling of the arms and legs by knife, culminating in decapitation. On the upside, luckier victims got to indulge in a good bit of opium beforehand, as an act of mercy. We'd argue that a better act of mercy would be not to carve up living people, but that's just us. The good news is <i>ling chi</i> was abolished. The bad news is that it wasn't until 1905, only 900 years late.</p>\n<p><b>Sawing:</b> Employed by historical free spirits like Caligula, Spanish Inquisitors, and--whaddya know--the ancient Chinese, death by sawing is kind of like the horror franchise <i>Saw</i>, except more horrific and not a movie. The convicted was strung up by the feet and sawed in twain, beginning at the crotch; his upside-down position ensured a continuous flow of blood (or whatever blood remained) to the brain, so he barely had to miss a moment of the terror until it was over. Recipients included such heinous criminals as adulterers and sodomites, plus a few saints, maybe the prophet Isaiah, and any young woman thought to be carrying Satan in her womb. That's the thing about the Beelzebaby--you never can be too sure, so kudos to the Spanish, because during the entire Inquisition, Satan's spawn wasn't born even once.</p>\n<p><b>Boiling Alive:</b> Fairly self-explanatory. Historically, execution by boiling is far more widespread than you'd think. In fact, it was prevalent in the Roman Empire, ancient China, Egypt, throughout the Middle East (where to conserve water they used oil), classical Japan, 17th-century India, England under Henry VIII, and Uganda under Idi Amin in the 1970s. More recently, the gruesome act seemed relegated exclusively to members of the crustacean family---until an autopsy report emerged from Uzbekistan in 2002 implicating the practice in at <i>least</i> one political prisoner's demise.</p>\n<p>Burning at the Stake: Particularly effective in the elimination of witches, heretics, Christians, Zoroastrians, Nordic thugs, British traitors (females only, please), homosexuals, and anyone else whose flesh is not flame-retardant, burning at the stake is the straightforward but reliable, the Toyota Corolla of capital punishment. Its advantages are obvious: It's easy to do--all you need is a stake and some burning--and it makes for a flashy public-service message. The upside of death by fire: You may die of carbon dioxide poisoning before you're engulfed by flame. The downside: You might not. Given the choice, we'd rather go like '30s movie star Lupe Velez, who committed suicide in 1944 by overdosing on sleeping pills and then reportedly drowning in her toilet. . . .</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">03 Toilet Facts</p>\n<p>Toilets are like oxygen or boyfriends: You tend not to think much about them until the moment you can't find any. Maybe it's time to give your W.C. a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. After all, you probably don't notice but you pay respect to the porcelain god six to eight times per day, on average--or thirty to forty times per day, if you're a six-year-old on a road trip (just joshing, kids). That makes for 2,500 trips to Flushville per year, comprising an average of three full years of your life. That's enough time to get a law degree . . . if only you hadn't spent it reading <i>mental_floss.</i></p>\n<p>Nazi war criminal and Gestapo founder Hermann Göring despised toilet paper (seriously). He refused to use it and instead bought handkerchiefs in bulk.</p>\n<p>In 1993, an Argentinian prankster switched the \"Women's\" and \"Men's\" signs in a series of public toilets. We don't see why this is particularly clever--the gender divide is the same whether you all go to Room A or Room B (except that women will get to peek at some urinals). Apparently, the Argentine government wasn't impressed by it either: They sentenced the bathroom bandit to three years in the clink (which supposedly left him flushed).</p>\n<p>The separate stall, a welcome innovation if ever there was one, is a relatively modern concept. The Romans and Greeks, for instance, saw toilet time as a social occasion and sat down in groups at their open-air toilets. That brings us back to the Greeks, which brings us to . . .<br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i> <br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n Excerpted from <b>Mental Floss: Scatterbrained</b> by <b>Virginia Editors of Mental Floss</b> Copyright © 2006 by Virginia Editors of Mental Floss.

The four-page preface clearly explains her choices. Charters, who came of age during the 1960s, concedes that some of the pieces are very personal, meant to reflect her intense emotional and intellectual experiences. The selections and omissions are determined to some extent by the ten topical sections: civil rights, war resistance, free speech, the counterculture (largely in music as rendered here), mind-altering drugs, Beat literature, African-American arts, the women's movement (especially the sexual revolution), environmental protection, and \"elegies\" (portraits of ten people who died during the decade). Charters (English/Univ. of Connecticut) gives short shrift to innovative pieces of narrative journalism--Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Joan Didion, Truman Capote are all excluded--but otherwise her choices seem unarguable. The introductions to each selection provide pertinent context, which is especially important because many of the selections are excerpts from books. A 25-page chronology of the decade will prove useful for those born after 1960, as well as offering forgotten tidbits for middle-aged and elderly readers.\n\n</article>"

Chosen for their value as excellent examples of the art of biography as well as for their superb writing, the excerpts present a broad range of American life, and offer vivid insight into the real-life events that shaped their authors. Here, readers can learn about the time when Harry Crews, playing as a boy, fell into a vat of boiling water with a dead hog; Chris Offutt joined the circus and watched a tattooed woman swallow a fluorescent light; and Frank Conroy practiced yo-yo tricks.</p>",
    "excerpt": "<b>Harry Crews(1935)</b><br>\n<p><i>Harry Crews was born the son of a farmer in Bacon County, Georgia, and grew up there. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a sergeant, then attended the University of Florida, where he became a professor of English in 1974.</i></p>\n<p>Author of more than a dozen novels, from The Gospel Singer (1968) to Scar Lover (1992), Crews has also written stories, essays, and nonfiction.</p>\n<p>Crews's memoir, A Childhood: The Biography of a Place, describes the first six years of his life, under circumstances \"where there wasn't enough money to close up a dead man's eyes.\" His family lived on a series of tenant farms in Bacon County. His father died when he was two. The \"daddy\" in this memoir is his stepfather, whom he loved. Later he learned that this man was his uncle.</p>\n<b>From A Childhood</b><br>\n<p>It has always seemed to me that I was not so much born into this life as I awakened to it. I remember very distinctly the awakening and the morning it happened. It was my first glimpse of myself, and all that I know now—the stories, and everything conjured up by them, that I have been writing about thus far—I obviously knew none of then, particularly anything about my real daddy, whom I was not to hear of until I was nearly six years old, not his name, not even that he was my daddy. Or if I did hear of him, I have no memory of it.</p>\n<p>I awoke in the middle of the morning in early summer from the place I'd been sleeping in the curving roots of a giant oak tree in front of a large white house. Off to the right, beyond the dirt road, my goats were trailing along in the ditch, grazing in the tough wire grass that grew there.Their constant bleating shook the warm summer air. I always thought of them as my goats although my brother usually took care of them. Before he went to the field that morning to work, he had let them out of the old tobacco barn where they slept at night. At my feet was a white dog whose name was Sam. I looked at the dog and at the house and at the red gown with little pearl-colored buttons I was wearing, and I knew that the gown had been made for me by my Grandma Hazelton and that the dog belonged to me. He went everywhere I went, and he always took precious care of me.</p>\n<p>Precious. That was my mama's word for how it was between Sam and me, even though Sam caused her some inconvenience from time to time. If she wanted to whip me, she had to take me in the house, where Sam was never allowed to go. She could never touch me when I was crying if Sam could help it. He would move quietly—he was a dog not given to barking very much—between the two of us and show her his teeth. Unless she took me somewhere Sam couldn't go, there'd be no punishment for me.</p>\n<p>The house there just behind me, partially under the arching limbs of the oak tree, was called the Williams place. It was where I lived with my mama and my brother, Hoyet, and my daddy, whose name was Pascal. I knew when I opened my eyes that morning that the house was empty because everybody had gone to the field to work. I also knew, even though I couldn't remember doing it, that I had awakened sometime in midmorning and come out onto the porch and down the steps and across the clean-swept dirt yard through the gate weighted with broken plow points so it would swing shut behind me, that I had come out under the oak tree and lain down against the curving roots with my dog, Sam, and gone to sleep. It was a thing I had done before. If I ever woke up and the house was empty and the weather was warm—which was the only time I would ever awaken to an empty house—I always went out under the oak tree to finish my nap. It wasn't fear or loneliness that drove me outside; it was just something I did for reasons I would never be able to discover.</p>\n<p>I stood up and stretched and looked down at my bare feet at the hem of the gown and said: \"I'm almost five and already a great big boy.\" It was my way of reassuring myself, but it was also something my daddy said about me and it made me feel good because in his mouth it seemed to mean I was almost a man.</p>\n<p>Sam immediately stood up too, stretched, reproducing, as he always did, every move I made, watching me carefully to see which way I might go. I knew I ought not to be outside lying in the rough curve of root in my cotton gown. Mama didn't mind me being out there under the tree, but I was supposed to get dressed first. Sometimes I did; often I forgot.</p>\n<p>So I turned and went back through the gate, Sam at my heels, and across the yard and up the steps onto the porch to the front door. When I opened the door, Sam stopped and lay down to wait. He would be there when I came out, no matter which door I used. If I went out the back door, he would somehow magically know it and he would be there. If I came out the side door by the little pantry, he would know that, too, and he would be there. Sam always knew where I was, and he made it his business to be there, waiting.</p>\n<p>I went into the long, dim, cool hallway that ran down the center of the house. Briefly I stopped at the bedroom where my parents slept and looked in at the neatly made bed and all the parts of the room, clean, with everything where it was supposed to be, just the way mama always kept it. And I thought of daddy, as I so often did because I loved him so much. If he was sitting down, I was usually in his lap. If he was standing up, I was usually holding his hand. He always said soft funny things to me and told me stories that never had an end but always continued when we met again.</p>\n<p>He was tall and lean with flat high cheekbones and deep eyes and black thick hair which he combed straight back on his head. And under the eye on his left cheek was the scarred print of a perfect set of teeth. I knew he had taken the scar in a fight, but I never asked him about it and the teeth marks in his cheek only made him seem more powerful and stronger and special to me.</p>\n<p>He shaved every morning at the water shelf on the back porch with a straight razor and always smelled of soap and whiskey. I knew mama did not like the whiskey, but to me it smelled sweet, better even than the soap. And I could never understand why she resisted it so, complained of it so, and kept telling him over and over again that he would kill himself and ruin everything if he continued with the whiskey. I did not understand about killing himself and I did not understand about ruining everything, but I knew the whiskey somehow caused the shouting and screaming and the ugly sound of breaking things in the night. The stronger the smell of whiskey on him, though, the kinder and gentler he was with me and my brother.</p>\n<p>I went on down the hallway and out onto the back porch and finally into the kitchen that was built at the very rear of the house. The entire room was dominated by a huge black cast-iron stove with six eyes on its cooking surface. Directly across the room from the stove was the safe, a tall square cabinet with wide doors covered with screen wire that was used to keep biscuits and fried meat and rice or almost any other kind of food that had been recently cooked. Between the stove and the safe sat the table we ate off of, a table almost ten feet long, with benches on each side instead of chairs, so that when we put in tobacco, there would be enough room for the hired hands to eat.</p>\n<p>I opened the safe, took a biscuit off a plate, and punched a hole in it with my finger. Then with a jar of cane syrup, I poured the hole full, waited for it to soak in good, and then poured again. When the biscuit had all the syrup it would take, I got two pieces of fried pork off another plate and went out and sat on the back steps, where Sam was already lying in the warm sun, his ears struck forward on his head. I ate the bread and pork slowly, chewing for a long time and sharing it all with Sam.</p>\n<p>When we had finished, I went back into the house, took off my gown, and put on a cotton undershirt, my overalls with twin galluses that buckled on my chest, and my straw hat, which was rimmed on the edges with a border of green cloth and had a piece of green cellophane sewn into the brim to act as an eyeshade. I was barefoot, but I wished very much I had a pair of brogans because brogans were what men wore and I very much wanted to be a man. In fact, I was pretty sure I already was a man, but the only one who seemed to know it was my daddy. Everybody else treated me like I was still a baby.</p>\n<p>I went out the side door, and Sam fell into step behind me as we walked out beyond the mule barn where four mules stood in the lot and on past the cotton house and then down the dim road past a little leaning shack where our tenant farmers lived, a black family in which there was a boy just a year older than I was. His name was Willalee Bookatee. I went on past their house because I knew they would be in the field, too, so there was no use to stop.</p>\n<p> I went through a sapling thicket and over a shallow ditch and finally climbed a wire fence into the field, being very careful of my overalls on the barbed wire. I could see them all, my family and the black tenant family, far off there in the shimmering heat of the tobacco field. They were pulling cutworms off the tobacco. I wished I could have been out there with them pulling worms because when you found one, you had to break it in half, which seemed great good fun to me. But you could also carry an empty Prince Albert tobacco can in your back pocket and fill it up with worms to play with later.</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p><P>In <i>Modern American Memoirs,</i> two very discerning writers and readers have selected samples from 35 of the finest memoirs written in this century, including contributions by such diverse writers as Margaret Mead, Malcolm X, Maxine Hong Kingston, Loren Eisely, and Zora Neale Hurston. Chosen for their value as excellent examples of the art of biography as well as for their superb writing, the excerpts present a broad range of American life, and offer vivid insight into the real-life events that shaped their authors. Here, readers can learn about the time when Harry Crews, playing as a boy, fell into a vat of boiling water with a dead hog; Chris Offutt joined the circus and watched a tattooed woman swallow a fluorescent light; and Frank Conroy practiced yo-yo tricks.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Annie Dillard and publisher Cort Conley have collected excerpts from the memoirs of 35 20th-century American authors. The selections represent the best in autobiographical writing published between 1917 and 1992. Included are nine women and 26 men, both black and white, some better known than others, all distinguished writers and wonderful storytellers. Chris Offutt's \"The Same River Twice\" tells about the author's stint working in the circus; Anne Moody's \"Coming of Age in Mississippi\" describes her participation in the 1963 Woolworth sit-in. The editors precede each entry with a biographical and contextual note. There's an opening essay on the art of the memoirist and an afterword listing additional classics in the genre. This rich collection serves as an introduction to the nation's best modern writers and a primer on the American experience. Highly recommended for all libraries.-Carol A. McAllister, Coll. of William and Mary Lib., Williamsburg, Va.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><p>The latest edition of this annual, assembled by the acclaimed writer and editor Philip Zaleski, not only showcases some of the finest writing of the year but offers astute perceptions on subjects that are universal, timeless, and yet deeply personal. Culled from an impressive variety of sources and ranging over topics as disparate as Shaker furniture, perfume, and the monastic life, the essays and poems collected here share a search for purpose beyond the mundane -- and find answers in the likeliest and unlikeliest of sources.<p>Here you will find George Packer&#8217;s &#147;The Moderate Martyr,&#8221; a profile of the peaceful Islamic visionary Mahmoud Muhammad Taha, alongside Sridhar Pappu&#8217;s report on &#147;the Preacher,&#8221; Bishop T. D. Jakes, the entrepreneurially inclined leader of one of the largest churches in the country. Garry Wills questions whether it is possible (or even desirable) to live according to the maxim &#147;What would Jesus do?&#8221; In response to the recent spate of atheist attacks on organized religion, Marilynne Robinson offers an insightful critique of &#147;Hysterical Scientism.&#8221; Adam Gopnik explores the link between Shaker beliefs and the austere beauty of Shaker creations, and Joseph Epstein muses on the reasons for broken friendships. Some of the essays are deeply personal&#58; Mary Gordon examines her complex relationship with her mother, and Pico Iyer reveals the place where he goes to be himself.<p>Including powerful poetry from notable contributors such as Deborah Digges, Galway Kinnell, and John Updike, and an introduction by Harvey Cox, The Best American Spiritual Writing 2007 is one of those transformative &#147;magical books&#8221; that Zaleski describes in his foreword, a volume that gracefully probes the role of faith in modern life while offering both spiritual insight and literary excellence.<p></p>",

EARLY WORKS: ACTOS, BERNABE AND PENSAMIENTO SERPENTINE is three books in one: 1) a collection of one act plays by Valdez and the famous farmworker theater, El Teatro Campesino, 2) one of the first fully realized, full-length plays by Valdez alone, and 3) an original narrative poem by Luis Valdez. In the first part are collected the original, improvised works of El Teatro Campesino that deal with the exploitation of Mexican farm labor in the California fields, the discrimination found by Mexicans in the schools, and Mexicans being turned into cannon fodder by the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Bernabe is a touching, Lorcaesque poetic drama about a town fool's enchantment and ultimate unity with the earth. Pensamiento serpentino is a long, philosophical poem, based on Mayan thought and cosmology, which analyzes the cultural, religious and political circumstances of Mexican Americans and prepares a metaphysical framework for their future.</p>",

    "excerpt": "FROM THE INTRODUCTION\n<p>The seasons are both segments of time and states of mind. Though ourword ‘‘season’’ derives from the Latin for ‘‘sowing’’ and refers thereby only to spring, every culture has had terms – whether winter and summer, or rainy and dry – for the sequence of great climatic changes by which the world transforms itself every year. But it’s more than what is going on outside. Our hearts have seasons as well. Mostly, we call them moods, and we lay our plans by their accustomed recurrences. We recall the crucial moments in our lives by the weather that still swirls around them in memory. Weddings and family reunions, getaways and homecomings are most often scheduled by the season. Yes, we have urgent appointments and traditional holidays, our deadlines and habits. But our bodies and their tides of desire seem to move more slowly, and are governed by the larger, more dramatic and decisive movements of the sun itself – the arrival of light and the opulence of warmth, then their slow fading and cold withdrawal. Aren’t, in fact, the seasons like the stages of a love affair?</p>\n<p>This is where the poets come in. They are enthusiasts and brooders. Love and death are their stock-in-trade. But first of all, they are observers. A strong imagination begins with a keen eye. The poet is interested in both the detail and the scheme, in both the streak on the tulip and the nature of beauty which the flower represents. This is why the seasons have, down the centuries, had a special appeal for poets. (It’s interesting though obvious to note that modern poets from England and especially from New England, where weather patterns are more extreme, are more likely to write about the seasons than poets from more steadily temperate parts.) This book is a virtual anthology of small details, because the seasons invite us to catalogue the terms of our love for the world. It takes hours of observation to get the tiniest half-line right that describes, say, the precise shade of a bird’s wing in flight. And such details are then the starting-point of metaphor. We can’t see anything exactly as it is unless we first see it as something else.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Editor Senelick (recipient of the George Jean Nathan Prize for dramatic criticism) has done an excellent job of selecting a wide-ranging, historically significant selection of theater reviews, essays, memoirs, diary entries, and criticism. Extending through time with pieces by such recognizable writers as Washington Irving, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain, as well as Henry Louis Gates, Susan Sontag, and Tony Kushner, this collection also includes lesser-known writers such as Olive Logan, who wrote \"About Nudity in the Theatre\" in 1866, and Congregational minister Rollin Lynde Hartt, who discusses melodrama as a positive benefit to the working class and its newfound leisure. Many of the writings included here can be found only in volumes that are not indexed and are housed in archives and rare-book collections. VERDICT This is not a documentary history or a survey of American theater and therefore stands somewhat alone on the theater studies shelf. Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy here, and readers who love theater as well as history will be entertained for many hours.—Susan Peters, Univ. of Texas, Galveston\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><P><b>Bum Rush the Page</b> is a groundbreaking collection, capturing the best new work from the poets who have brought fresh energy, life, and relevance to American poetry.<P>&#8220;Here is a democratic orchestration of voices and visions, poets of all ages, ethnicities, and geographic locations coming together to create a dialogue and to jam&#8211;not slam. This is our mouth on paper, our hearts on our sleeves, our refusal to shut up and swallow our silence. These poems are tough, honest, astute, perceptive, lyrical, blunt, sad, funny, heartbreaking, and true. They shout, they curse, they whisper, and sing. But most of all, they tell it like it is.&#8221; <br>&#8211;Tony Medina, from the Introduction</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>To most readers, the hundreds of tightly rhymed, orally friendly poems here will read as \"slam.\" But in his introduction, Medina, a poet and activist, takes great pains to separate the poems from slam's crowd-pleasing limitations, and uses the term \"def jam\" to describe the political spoken-word poetry he and Rivera, also a poet-activist, have collected. Medina's and Rivera's emphasis is on the poem and its subject matter, not the poet, which makes for a remarkably democratic anthology. Every poet has about the same page and a half of space. The book's design puts the poets' names in a very small type. None of the big names June Jordan, Reg E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Wanda Coleman, Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka are given more attention than the less published. Organized by subjects such as \"Blood, I Say, Study our Story, Sing this Song,\" \"Drums Drown Out Our Sorrow\" and \"Seeds of Resistance,\" most of the poems use urban imagery, tough talk and declaration. Most are identity-centered, anti-racist and pro-activist. Many focus on current events. There are, for instance, at least four poems about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Ghanaian immigrant killed by New York policemen as he stood in his doorway. All mention the 41 shots; all include the word \"mother.\" There are poems about Shaka Sankofa (convicted of murder at 17, and executed nearly 20 years later under Texas's then-Governor George W. Bush), and homages to Cuban bandleader Tito Puente. Some readers will wish for more variation of theme and for more layered meanings, but the topicality and directness of the poems make this an ideal textbook for introductory poetry classes, especially for urban high school students, and for anyone interestedin poetry as a social art.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>To most readers, the hundreds of tightly rhymed, orally friendly poems here will read as \"slam.\" But in his introduction, Medina, a poet and activist, takes great pains to separate the poems from slam's crowd-pleasing limitations, and uses the term \"def jam\" to describe the political spoken-word poetry he and Rivera, also a poet-activist, have collected. Medina's and Rivera's emphasis is on the poem and its subject matter, not the poet, which makes for a remarkably democratic anthology. Every poet has about the same page and a half of space. The book's design puts the poets' names in a very small type. None of the big names June Jordan, Reg E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Wanda Coleman, Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka are given more attention than the less published. Organized by subjects such as \"Blood, I Say, Study our Story, Sing this Song,\" \"Drums Drown Out Our Sorrow\" and \"Seeds of Resistance,\" most of the poems use urban imagery, tough talk and declaration. Most are identity-centered, anti-racist and pro-activist. Many focus on current events. There are, for instance, at least four poems about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Ghanaian immigrant killed by New York policemen as he stood in his doorway. All mention the 41 shots; all include the word \"mother.\" There are poems about Shaka Sankofa (convicted of murder at 17, and executed nearly 20 years later under Texas's then-Governor George W. Bush), and homages to Cuban bandleader Tito Puente. Some readers will wish for more variation of theme and for more layered meanings, but the topicality and directness of the poems make this an ideal textbook for introductory poetry classes, especially for urban high school students, and for anyone interestedin poetry as a social art.

The editors of this overstuffed anthology never quite get around to defining just what \"outlaw literature\" is and what makes it illicit, dangerous, or otherwise suspect, except to hint that it stands in some sort of opposition to the world of \"reality shows, Botox, or IPOs,\" to say nothing of a \"culture coming of age in the grip of Google and Wal-mart.\" Resounding sentiments, those, and the editors, famed counterculturists in their own right, presumably know outlaw literature when they see it. Still, you might wonder: What do Richard Brautigan and Mickey Spillane, who took home hefty advances and even heftier royalty checks, really have in common with, say, Boxcar Bertha and Sonny Barger? Would Emma Goldman have much to say to Valerie Solanas, Ray Bradbury to DMX? Only a deconstructionist, perhaps, could say with any authority. For our purposes, being an outlaw writer appears mostly to mean using lots of naughty words (Barry Gifford: \"Willie Wild Wong, you dumb motherfucker!\"; Jim Carroll: \"'I am the proletariat, you dumb bastard,' he said, 'and I think those motherfuckers are off their rockers\") and doing lots of naughty and unhealthful things (Norman Mailer: \"I threw up a little while ago and my breath is foul\"; William Burroughs: \"Junk sickness, suspended by codeine and hop, numbed by weeks of constant drinking, came back on me full force\"). Still, there are lots of good and memorable things here, among them Paul Krassner's memoir of dropping acid with Groucho Marx; Dee Dee Ramone's heartfelt plea, \"Please don't kill me now, God. I would love to be the last Ramone to die\" (no such luck, sorry); and MalcolmX's spot-on prediction that after his death \"the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with 'hate.'\" A freeform category, then, marked by a rather shapeless but still quite readable, collection. Good stuff, if you like that sort of thing.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Is an outlaw writer one who threatens to fill Marshall McLuhan with pencil lead? The editors of this overstuffed anthology never quite get around to defining just what \"outlaw literature\" is and what makes it illicit, dangerous, or otherwise suspect, except to hint that it stands in some sort of opposition to the world of \"reality shows, Botox, or IPOs,\" to say nothing of a \"culture coming of age in the grip of Google and Wal-mart.\" Resounding sentiments, those, and the editors, famed counterculturists in their own right, presumably know outlaw literature when they see it. Still, you might wonder: What do Richard Brautigan and Mickey Spillane, who took home hefty advances and even heftier royalty checks, really have in common with, say, Boxcar Bertha and Sonny Barger? Would Emma Goldman have much to say to Valerie Solanas, Ray Bradbury to DMX? Only a deconstructionist, perhaps, could say with any authority. For our purposes, being an outlaw writer appears mostly to mean using lots of naughty words (Barry Gifford: \"Willie Wild Wong, you dumb motherfucker!\"; Jim Carroll: \"'I am the proletariat, you dumb bastard,' he said, 'and I think those motherfuckers are off their rockers\") and doing lots of naughty and unhealthful things (Norman Mailer: \"I threw up a little while ago and my breath is foul\"; William Burroughs: \"Junk sickness, suspended by codeine and hop, numbed by weeks of constant drinking, came back on me full force\"). Still, there are lots of good and memorable things here, among them Paul Krassner's memoir of dropping acid with Groucho Marx; Dee Dee Ramone's heartfelt plea, \"Please don't kill me now, God. I would love to be the last Ramone to die\" (no such luck, sorry); and MalcolmX's spot-on prediction that after his death \"the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with 'hate.'\" A freeform category, then, marked by a rather shapeless but still quite readable, collection. Good stuff, if you like that sort of thing.\n\n</article>"

Hartman, an eloquent, middle-aged prisoner convicted of murder at 19, tells a sad but unsentimental story: a rough childhood and a wish for invincibility fueled Hartman's youth and downfall, but in the time since, he has married in prison, fathered a child, and currently works to improve the broken U.S. prison system. Hartman discovered his talent in a writing class, after having abandoned drugs; using it, he examines up close the \"mad, violent circus\" of prison life, his place in it, and the fate of his fellow prisoners: \"Under the big tent of this brutally unnatural environment, few of us ever take the frightening step of analyzing our deeper motives.\" <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "excerpt": "<p>Introduction: Americans Dreaming</p>\n<p>Whenever anyone asks my opinion about the difference between novels and short stories, I tell them that there is no distinction between the genres. They are essentially the same thing, I always reply.<br>\n How can you say that? the fiction lover asks. Stories are small gems, perfectly cut to expose every facet of an idea, which is in turn illuminated by ten thousand tiny shafts of light.<br>\n But I hold my ground, answering the metaphor with a simile. A novel, I say, is like a mountain—superior, vast, and immense. Its apex is in the clouds and it appears to us as a higher being—a divinity. Mountains loom and challenge; they contain myriad life forms and cannot be seen by anyone attempting the climb. Mountains can be understood only by years of negotiating their trails and sheer faces. They contain a wide variety of atmospheres and are complex and immortal.<br>\n You cannot approach a mountain unless you are completely prepared for the challenge. In much the same way, you can’t begin to read (or write) a novel without attempting to embrace a life much larger than the range of any singular human experience.<br>\n Thinking in this way, I understand the mountain and the novel to be impossible in everyday human terms. Both emerge from a distance that can be approached only by faith. And when you get there, all you find is yourself. The beauty or terror you experience is your understanding of how far you’ve come, your being stretched further than is humanly possible.<br>\n The fiction lover agrees. She says, Yes, of course. The novel is a large thing. The novel stands against the backdrop of human existence just as mountains dominate the landscape. But stories are simple things, small aspects of human foibles and quirks. A story can be held in a glance or a half- remembered dream.<br>\n It’s a good argument, and I wouldn’t refute it. But I will say that if novels are mountains, then stories are far-flung islands that one comes upon in the limitless horizon of the sea. Not big islands like Hawaii, but small, craggy atolls inhabited by eclectic and nomadic life forms that found their way there in spite of tremendous odds. One of these small islets can be fully explored in a few hours. There’s a grotto, a sandy beach, a new species of wolf spider, and maybe the remnants of an ancient culture that came here and moved on or, possibly, just died out.<br>\n These geologic comparisons would seem to support the fiction reader’s claim that novels and short stories are different categories, distant cousins in the linguistic universe. But where did those wolf spiders come from? And who were the people who came here and died? And why, when I walk around this footprint of land, do I feel that something new arises with each day? I eat fish that live in the caves below the waves. I see dark shadows down there. I dream of the firmament that lies below the ocean, the mountain that holds up that small span of land.<br>\n I cannot climb the mountain that sits in the sea, but from where I stand it comes to me in detritus and dreams.<br>\n Short story writers must be confident of that suboceanic mountain in order to place their tale in the world. After all, fiction mostly resides in the imagination of the reader. All the writer can do is hint at a world that calls forth the dream, telling the story that exhorts us to call the possibility into being.<br>\n The writers represented in this collection have told stories that suggest much larger ideas. I found myself presented with the challenge of simple human love contrasted against structures as large as religion and death. The desire to be loved or to be seen, represented on a canvas so broad that it would take years to explain all the roots that bring us to the resolution.<br>\n In many of the stories we find exiles, people who have lost their loved ones, their homelands, their way. These stories are simple and exquisite, but they aren’t merely tales of personal loss. Mothers have left us long before the mountains were shifted by southward-moving ice floes. Men have been broken by their dreams for almost as long as the continents have been drifting. And every day someone opens her eyes and sees a world that she never expected could be there.<br>\n These short stories are vast structures existing mostly in the subconscious of our cultural history. They will live with the reader long after the words have been translated into ideas and dreams. That’s because a good short story crosses the borders of our nations and our prejudices and our beliefs. A good short story asks a question that can’t be answered in simple terms. And even if we come up with some understanding, years later, while glancing out of a window, the story still has the potentiall to return, to alter right there in our mind and change everything.</p>\n<p>—Walter Mosley</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2003 by Houghton Mifﬂin Comppany....

Does a journey of sexual discovery have to be quite this filthy? But if Cordell's misadventures were too palatable, if this were a novel one could read over lunch, it wouldn't be authentic porn. Fans of his Easy Rawlins series might be put off by the surreal absurdity, but perhaps Mosley is reaching out to new readers. Or, like Bill Clinton, a fan of Mosley's early work, perhaps he's doing something audacious because he can.</p>",

It would be unfair to what Mosley is attempting here - to put sex at the center of Cordell’s existence and to turn the reader on in the process - to describe the sex scenes with that wan word “erotica,” a word almost always used to demonstrate that the user is above those coarse enough to be aroused by mere pornography. And judged solely by its intentions to appeal to what prosecutors in obscenity cases used to call the prurient interest, the novel is a success. Good porn is tough to write and when talented writers decide it shouldn’t be left to the hacks, the result can be something as joyous as Nicholson Baker’s <i>Vox</i> and <i>The Fermata</i>. Or even something as voluptuously smutty as the porn-for-cash Alexander Trocchi turned out for Maurice Girodias’s Olympia Press.<br>\n— The New York Times\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Tracy Quan</h4>When a national treasure like Mosley decides to publish a dirty novel, snippy reactions are inevitable. Does a journey of sexual discovery have to be quite this filthy? But if Cordell's misadventures were too palatable, if this were a novel one could read over lunch, it wouldn't be authentic porn. Fans of his Easy Rawlins series might be put off by the surreal absurdity, but perhaps Mosley is reaching out to new readers. Or, like Bill Clinton, a fan of Mosley's early work, perhaps he's doing something audacious because he can.<br>\n— The Washington Post\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Mosley returns from the vastly underrated Fortunate Son and from Fear of the Dark with a piece of what one might call \"deep erotica\": there's plenty of sex, and also plenty of motivation for it within protagonist Cordel Carmel's travails and ruminations, as far-fetched as they can get. After a charged-but-chaste lunch with young Lucy Carmichael (a blonde in her early 20s looking to be introduced to Cordel's art agent friend), Cordel, 45, walks in on Joelle (his longtime, non-live-in girlfriend): Joelle's being very consensually sodomized by a white man wearing a red condom, their (very well-endowed) mutual acquaintance, Johnny Fry. Cordel walks out quietly, without being seen. In short order, Cordel buys a porno video and gets enraptured with its sadist star, Sisypha; quits his freelance-translation gig; has conflicted, amazing sex with Joelle (who continues to lie to him); has unconflicted, amazing sex with Lucy (who seems very nice) and with voluptuous neighbor Sasha Bennett (who seems way crazy); meets Sisypha for an Eyes Wide Shut-like experience; seduces the young, ghetto Monica Wells; and finally, within the week, has his confrontation with Johnny Fry. Though it all, Cordel's thoughts on humiliation, submission, pain, family, aging and abuse manage to sustain the wisp-thin plot of this total male fantasy. (Jan.) Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Like his last two adult novels (The Wave and Fortunate Son), Mosley's latest is a departure from his best-selling Easy Rawlins mysteries. His protagonist, 45-year-old translator Cordell Carmel, considers himself lucky that girlfriend Joelle is so undemanding that they spend only one night a week together. Stopping by Joelle's apartment unannounced one day, he discovers her with another man, aspiring musician Johnny Fry. That night, Cordell buys his first X-rated DVD and begins a journey of sexual self-discovery. Watching The Myth of Sisypha, the vividly described adult film he has purchased, opens Cordell's eyes to a world of sex and power, pleasure and pain. He explores his renewed sexual energy with a young photographer he's helping, an attractive neighbor, a French student he meets on the subway, and Sisypha herself. Mosley's decision to subtitle the book \"a sexistenial novel\" implies a more philosophical approach to sexuality than the gratuitous sexual episodes described here. Recommended only for libraries with strong demand for all of Mosley's work.-Karen Kleckner, Deerfield P.L., IL Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>And now for something completely different from Easy Rawlins' prolific creator (Cinnamon Kiss, 2005, etc.), who's branching out into still another genre. Cordell Carmel, a middle-aged New York translator everybody calls \"L,\" decides one afternoon on his way to a conference to wait a few hours for a first-class train to Philadelphia. Heading over to girlfriend Joelle Petty's apartment, he finds her sharing a frantic embrace with Johnny Fry, a white man who'd like to switch from being a personal trainer to playing classical guitar. Instead of calling attention to himself, L leaves quietly (though he does turn back briefly when he thinks Jo is crying out in pain) and proceeds to pull down the edifice of his carefully constructed life. He smashes his hand against a brick wall, orders a high-fat meal, buys an expensive bottle of cognac and takes home a porn video, The Myth of Sisypha, that puts him in touch with his appetite for passion and pain. The next day, after missing the conference and infuriating his agent, L begins to grab every chance at a new life. He reinvents himself as an agent for photographer Lucy Carmichael, flirts with female acquaintances and takes three of them to bed, then returns to Jo bent on getting some of the kind of wild, crazy sex she's been enjoying with Johnny. But it's The Myth of Sisypha that has the most profound impact on L, and when he has a chance to meet the video's star and embark on a series of scenarios that cross the line from NC-17 to XXX, his obsessions with getting off and killing Johnny are joined by another kind of desire as tender as it is unlikely. An interesting look at a male in midlife crisis. As L says, \"I had come alive. And lifehurt.\"Agent: Gloria Loomis/Watkins Loomis Agency Inc.\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><p>Originally published in 1993, this pioneering anthology is a powerful polemic for fundamental cultural change&#58; the transformation of basic attitudes about power, gender, race, and sexuality. This edition adds new pieces on Internet pornography, the role of sports in sexual violence, and rape as a calculated instrument of war. The diverse contributors, which include bell hooks, Andrea Dworkin, Michael Messner, Yvette Flores, and Ntozake Shange, are activists, opinion leaders, theologians, policymakers, educators, and authors of both genders who tackle such hot-button issues as pornography and the intersection of race and rape. <p>The book's statistics have been thoroughly updated, as have essays about sexual violence in K-12 schools and in the church. New pieces from within America's immigrant communities depict struggles with domestic violence, sexual harassment, and community stigmas against reporting rape. This violence, not limited to one race, creed, or nationality, has its roots in cultural biases that are still much in need of change.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The contributors to this invaluable sourcebook share the conviction that rape is epidemic because our society encourages male aggression and tacitly or overtly supports violence against women. Cumulatively, these 34 essays by such figures as Gloria Steinem, Andrea Dworkin, Ntozake Shange, Michael Kimmel and Louise Erdrich situate rape on a continuum extending from sexist language to pornography, sexual harassment in schools and the workplace, wife battering and date and marital rape. Most of the selections were written for this volume. Highlights include a proposal to make rape a presidential election issue, an analysis of the churches' ambivalent response to societal violence, guidelines for raising boys to view themselves as nurturing, nonviolent fathers and inspirational visions of personal or institutional change.

    "overview": "<p>Robert Frost never felt more at home in America than when watching baseball \"be it in park or sand lot.\" Full of heroism and heartbreak, the most beloved of American sports is also the most poetic, and writers have been drawn to this sport as to no other. With <b>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</b>, The Library of America presents the story of the national adventure as revealed through the fascinating lens of the great American game.</p>\n<p>Philip Roth considers the terrible thrill of the adolescent centerfielder; Richard Ford listens to minor-league baseball on the radio while driving cross-country; Amiri Baraka remembers the joy of watching the Newark Eagles play in the era before Jackie Robinson shattered the color line. Unforgettable portraits of legendary players who have become icons-Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Hank Aaron-are joined by glimpses of lesser-known characters such as the erudite Moe Berg, who could speak a dozen languages \"but couldn't hit in any of them.\"</p>\n<p>Poems in <b>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</b> include indispensable works whose phrases have entered the language-Ernest Thayer's \"Casey at the Bat\" and Franklin P. Adams's \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\"-as well as more recent offerings from May Swenson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Martin Espada. Testimonies from classic oral histories offer insights into the players who helped enshrine the sport in the American imagination. Spot reporting by Heywood Broun and Damon Runyon stands side by side with journalistic profiles that match baseball legends with some of our finest writers: John Updike on Ted Williams, Gay Talese on Joe DiMaggio, Red Smith on Lefty Grove.</p>",
    "excerpt": "As a young man, Charles Emmett Van Loan (1876-1919) worked at a meat packing company and went to minor-league baseball games around Los Angeles with his boss. He began taking notes on what he saw, and when he converted them into dispatches and submitted them to the <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i>, he was on his way to becoming California's best baseball writer. He worked for the <i>Los Angeles Morning Herald</i> in 1904, and then for the <i>Denver Post</i>, where he met Damon Runyon. By 1910, the two men were house mates in New York, colleagues at the sports department of the American. Over the next nine years Van Loan's journalism and short stories about boxing, horseracing, golf, Hollywood, and of course baseball appeared in a number of publications, including <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, for which he served two stints as an editor. During the first, he became the editorial conduit for Ring Lardner's humorous sketches that would later be collected as the novel <i>You Know Me Al</i>. This piece, published in <i>The Outing</i> magazine in 1909, shows Van Loan's ample humor and his sophisticated understanding of the skills involved in baseball. The portraits of Ty Cobb and Hal Chase are especially interesting since they provide glimpses of the two players before a reputation for recalcitrance (Cobb) or dishonesty (Chase) overtook them.\n<p><b>Baseball as the Bleachers Like It</b><br>\n<b>By Charles E. Van Loan</b></p>\n<p>The man in the box office, whose swift, money-changing fingers play on the pulse of the amusement-loving public, will tell you that a baseball franchise in a large city is a \"mint.\" The man in the box office cares little for sport; he views it with the sordid eye of one who thinks in figures and dreams in dollars. Those who make a study of the great business of providing amusement for a nation, will tell you that where other outdoor sports and \"attractions\" count their devotees by tens, baseball drags its hundreds and even thousands through the turnstiles. There must be some good reason for this state of affairs.</p>\n<p>The same men sit on the bleachers day after day, their straw hats tilted down over keen eyes, their fingers fumbling score cards and pencils. Everything that the gallery is to the stage, the bleachers are to the diamond. The most merciless critic may be found somewhere behind first or third base where he can see everything which happens. The grand stand may be all very well for the thin-skinned ones who must mingle personal comfort with their amusement; the true baseball fan sits on the bleachers, trimmed down to his shirt sleeves. No wire nettings in front of him, if you please.</p>\n<p>Why is he there day after day? He can hope to see nothing absolutely new, for in the present high stage of its development, professional baseball has reached a point where one new play a season is the average. What is the lure of this mighty magnet -- this thing, half sport, half business, which draws its millions of dollars every year?</p>\n<p>Is it the science of the game -- the inside baseball?</p>\n<p>Nine tenths of the men who go to the theater hope for one of two things: they want to be amused or thrilled. The problem play does not appeal to the man who has found life its own problem.</p>\n<p>The man who goes to the race track for an afternoon's sport and does not sell his interest for a bookmaker's ticket hopes to see a great race with a nose-and-nose finish and three horses driving at the wire.</p>\n<p>Patrons of the gentle art of the lamented Queensberry, hoot two clever men, who spar for points without damage or gore. These are the same men who make baseball profitable; what then do they see in the national game?</p>\n<p><b>PROBLEM PLAYS ON THE DIAMOND</b></p>\n<p>For example: it is the ninth inning; the score is 1 to 0, and it has been a battle of the pitchers from the clang of the gong. There have been a few scattering hits, a few brilliant bits of individual fielding, and many weak flies hoisted into the air. It has been a very scientific contest from first to last -- so full of science that there has been little else. Ask your bleacher friend what he thinks of that sort of a game.</p>\n<p>\"We-ell,\" he will say, \"Matty was good today and so was the other fellow. We won, of course, but...\"</p>\n<p>Behind that \"but\" lurks the secret of the whole thing, the power of the game over its millions of devotees. The melodrama had been lacking; the sensational plays which stir the blood, the long sharp hits and the brilliant catches. It had been a problem play with two stars in the cast and sixteen walking gentlemen.</p>\n<p>Now then, watch your friend in the last half of the eighth inning with the score 3 to 2 against the home team, two men out and the bases filled. It has been a slashing contest, full of free hitting, sharp fielding, and the brilliant double plays which hold the score in small figures.</p>\n<p>The hard-hitting outfielder of the home team is at bat. Your friend is out on the edge of his seat. Any sort of a safe hit means a tied score; a long single might win the game, and a double... your friend hopes for a double! Watch his eyes when the umpire's right arm jerks upward as the first ball splits the plate.</p>\n<p>\"Aw, what was he waiting for? Might have known the first ball would be a groover!\" Your friend seems peevish.</p>\n<p>One ball. Wild cheering. Two balls. A demonstration and yells of \"Going Up!\" Ah! He missed that one! Well, he still has the big one left. Three balls.</p>\n<p>From the box back of first base comes the sharp bark of the coacher.</p>\n<p>\"Three and two now, ole boy! Three and two! Make him be good!\"</p>\n<p>Watch your friend now. He has stopped breathing. His cigar is dying an unpleasant death. He does not care. Three and two! He has eyes and ears and a taste for one thing only -- the drama spread out before him.</p>\n<p>Once more the gray-clad pitcher cuddles the ball to his chest, nodding slightly in answer to the catcher's signal. Up goes his foot, back goes his body from the hips, a forward lunge, and the arm snaps out in a half circle like a powerful spring uncoiled. The ball flies straight for the catcher's mitt and at the same instant the three base runners flash into motion. Three and two and two men down -- nothing to do but run.</p>\n<p>The batter pivots with a mighty swing, there is a splitting crack as wood meets leather, and a white dot shoots out over the second baseman's head, mocking his futile leap. The center fielder is sheering off toward right, racing with a forlorn hope and the right fielder, wiser still, is already on his way toward the fence.</p>\n<p><b>DELIRIUM ON THE BLEACHERS</b></p>\n<p>How about your friend now? There he is, standing up in his place and tearing the air with a series of Comanche war whoops. All around you men, and women too, are screaming unintelligible words. The man beside you who gave you such a nasty look when you stepped on his feet, hammers you between the shoulder blades and bellows into your ear:</p>\n<p>\"A triple with bases full! A triple! What do you know about that, eh?\"</p>\n<p>What is the attraction in baseball? Your answer is out there on the bleachers, several thousand strong. Those leaping, howling, white-shirted dervishes have given it to you. It is the melodrama which makes baseball.</p>\n<p>A baseball fan will go to a dozen poor games rather than miss that sort of a play, and when at last he recovers his breath he will tell you that he is amply repaid for his time and money.</p>\n<p>The scientific contest interests him because he understands every move in the game, but if you want to bring him to his feet, you must give him melodrama.</p>\n<p>Inside baseball? Yes, he knows something of that, too. He has made a study of inside baseball, sitting above the great masters. He recognizes and appreciates good pitching, but the thing which brings him to his feet with the howl of a timber wolf is the long clean drive to the fence, or the seemingly impossible catch. The melodrama \"gets\" him every time.</p>\n<p>One of the grizzled old baseball generals once said:</p>\n<p>\"Give me a team of sluggers and I'll chance the errors.\" He knew what the fans wanted to see.</p>\n<p>Ask the first youngster you meet to name the two greatest baseball players in the two big leagues. Nine times out of ten the answer will come like a flash:</p>\n<p>\"Hans Wagner and Ty Cobb!\"</p>\n<p>These are the names of the two great batters, Wagner in the National and Cobb in the American League.</p>\n<p>The tenth youngster may take time to think and give you another answer. If you lift his hat you will find that youth has a high, intellectual brow. He will enjoy problem plays when he grows up.</p>\n<p>The leading men of this national melodrama form interesting contrasts. Some of them have found it a long road from the sandlots to the pay roll of a big league team; others jumped into fame in a single week. Personal appearance counts for nothing; nationality counts for nothing; it is the man who \"delivers the goods\" who is always sure of his welcome from the lynx-eyed critics on the sunny seats.</p>\n<p>Baseball fans are quick to recognize and identify the thing which we call \"class.\" After your bleacher friend has watched a visiting team through an entire series he can place his finger on the weak spot in the organization; he can tell you how the games were lost and which players lost them.</p>\n<p>Of the ball players who have jumped into prominence at a single bound, two might be mentioned: Hal Chase and Tyrus Cobb.</p>\n<p><b>CHASE BREAKS INTO FAST COMPANY</b></p>\n<p>A few years ago the Los Angeles team of the Pacific Coast League had need of a substitute first baseman. Frank Dillon, first baseman and team captain, had signed a contract to play with the Brooklyn club of the National League. Dillon was anxious to remain in California and did not report with the Eastern team for spring practice.</p>\n<p>The manager of the Southern team, looking about him for a substitute player, engaged a boy from a small college team in central California, devoutly hoping that he might not have any use for him.</p>\n<p>On the opening day of the league season, Dillon went out on the field to put the team through the preliminary practice, playing his old position at first base. The substitute sat on the bench. His face was unknown to the Southern baseball fans who immediately dubbed him a \"bush leaguer\" and forgot about him. The youngster sat there on the bench, nursing an odd-shaped pancake glove; a battered relic contrasting strangely with his new flannel uniform and spiked shoes.</p>\n<p>It was his first appearance in \"organized baseball.\" Success meant a chance to earn money; failure meant a ticket back to the prune orchards of Santa Clara County.</p>\n<p>The gong clanged, announcing the opening of the game. The umpire drew a paper from his pocket, showed it to Dillon, and the captain and first baseman slowly left the field. He had been informed that every game in which he played would be declared forfeited. Baseball magnates have many ways of protecting themselves in business deals; Dillon had signed with Brooklyn and Brooklyn meant to have him.</p>\n<p>The long-legged country boy arose and ambled out to Dillon's old position. The stands were in an uproar. Dillon had been the idol of the baseball public; the best first baseman in the league and the brainiest team captain the town had ever had. The contagion spread to the Los Angeles players, not one of whom had confidence in the raw college boy, thus thrust into an important position.</p>\n<p>It would be hard to imagine a more unfortunate first appearance. The game opened with a rush. The first batter smashed a ground ball at the Los Angeles shortstop and tore down the line to first base. Mechanically the shortstop raced over, dropped his glove in front of the ball, and faced about to make the throw to first base. Instead of Dillon, there was the \"bush league kid\" on the bag.</p>\n<p>The base runner was a fast man; in the twinkling of an eye the thing had been done -- the panic was working. Instead of the perfect line \"peg\" to first base, the shortstop threw fully eight feet outside the bag and correspondingly high, shooting the ball with the speed of a rifle bullet. It would have been a vicious throw for a right-hander to care for, even though on his glove-hand side; the bush league boy was a left-handed player and wore the glove on his right hand. The ball was coming to his bare hand and coming with such speed that there was little chance to hold it, even if a man cared to risk injury by reaching for a wide ball with the bare hand.</p>\n<p><b>\"ACCIDENT\" THAT BECAME A HABIT</b></p>\n<p>With the fraction of a second in which to decide what to do, the country boy whirled with his back to the diamond, hooked the spikes of his left shoe in the bag, and thrust out a long right arm for a backhand catch. The runner was beaten a stride on a circus catch which few big-leaguers would care to attempt.</p>\n<p>After the cheering, the bleacherites decided that it had been a blind, back-hand stab or a lucky accident. Twenty minutes later every man inside the grounds knew that he was seeing first base played as no youngster had ever played it before. The infield, still in a state of panic, threw the ball high, wide, and on both sides of him, but the flat pancake glove was always there when it arrived.</p>\n<p>The boy covered the ground with great loose-jointed strides, dug up impossible ground balls beyond the reach of an ordinary fielding first baseman, picked line drives out of the air, nipped bunts ten feet from the plate, caught advancing runners, and capped the climax by starting and finishing a double play thought to be possible with only one first baseman in America, Fred Tenney of the Nationals. There was but one verdict at the end of the game; the boy was the greatest first baseman ever seen on the Pacific Coast. He found his place in a single afternoon.</p>\n<p>On the next opening day, the youngster wore a New York uniform. New York had heard of him as a marvel and a boy wonder, but New York accepts no verdict except her own. In less than a week Hal Chase was the baseball sensation of the season, and baseball critics burned up columns in an attempt to analyze his method of playing his position. In the end everybody agreed that it was not possible to understand a raw boy who broke into the fastest company in the business, ready-made, as it were. The veterans of the American League could not teach him anything about inside ball; he was a revelation to his team mates and a terror to opposing clubs.</p>\n<p>Chase is still the premier first baseman of the country and the great star of baseball melodrama. He makes his plays by some unerring instinct which must have been born in him, and when it comes to handling bad throws at first base, there never was a player like him. Time after time he has been seen to turn his head away from a lowthrown ball and jam his glove down, making a blind catch of a ball which he could not have followed with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Fielders have little trouble with ground balls, but this is because they can move about and suit the catch to the bound of the ball. The first baseman is anchored to the bag; he must play the ball as it comes to him or miss the base runner.</p>\n<p>Other men have had more years of experience; many players are better at postmortem analysis of a baseball problem, but when a ball is hit down to Hal Chase, you will see the bleachers come up as one man. The fans never know what he is going to do with the ball when he gets it, but they do know that there will be no fumbling or \"booting,\" but a chain-lightning play directed at the one spot where the most damage can be done. Chase is the personification of baseball by instinct and the most popular first baseman the country has ever seen.</p>\n<p><b>\"TY\" COBB'S FIRST BASEBALL MONEY</b></p>\n<p>\"Ty\" Cobb was not so fortunate in his beginning. Tyrus was born in Georgia and early decided to be a semi-professional ball player. The difference between a professional and a semi-professional is that the former has a stated salary and always gets it, while the latter takes what he can get when he can get it.</p>\n<p>Young Cobb walked six miles in the hot sun to play his first \"money\" game. When the receipts had been counted, Cobb's share was one dollar and twenty-five cents. He walked six miles to his home and on the way decided that there was a future in professional baseball.</p>\n<p>The Charleston team secured him. He was a wild, erratic youngster who could bat like a demon, but never knew when to stop running bases. It is just as important to know when to stop running as it is to know when to begin. He gained the reputation of a crazy base runner and Charleston sold him to Augusta for one hundred and fifty dollars and was glad to get the money.</p>\n<p>Augusta tried him and found the same fault. He could hit, but he was wild and discipline irked him. He was a firebrand on the team and he would fight on the field or off. Ty won and lost several battles with the Augusta players and then the management sold him to Detroit for seven hundred dollars -- the greatest bargain in the history of the game.</p>\n<p>In Detroit young Mr. Cobb, the firebrand, found men who made baseball a study. It was a slugging team, but mixed with the hitting was the judgment which wins games. The players took a hand in taming that hot Southern blood. They argued with him, but as Ty would rather fight than argue, most of the debates ended on the floor of the dressing room. Those cool, seasoned veterans of the Tiger team knew that in Cobb they had a phenomenon, so they went at him methodically, literally \"licking him into shape.\" Some of them fought him more than once. Even to this day McIntyre plays left field and Cobb right field, because it is necessary to keep these two stars as far apart as possible.</p>\n<p>Cobb has lost most of his rough edges. He has gone out of the rough-and-tumble business; he sheds no more blood in defense of his principles. He knows when to quit running bases, hits the ball hard and often, and makes doubles on hits which any other man would call legitimate singles.</p>\n<p>He is as fast as a thunderbolt on the lines and the most daring man on a slide that baseball has seen in many a day. His slim, wiry legs are covered with bruises from April until October and he is always slightly lame until he hits the ball; then he forgets his soreness. Absolutely fearless, of great hitting ability, and a fighter every inch, Cobb is one of the great drawing cards in the baseball of today.</p>\n<p><b>THE MAN WHO HITS EVERYTHING</b></p>\n<p>Then there is the veteran Hans Wagner whose big stick has kept Pittsburgh in the first division for more years than he cares to remember. Hans is the last man in the world who would be taken for a great ball player. On appearance, he might be a piano mover. Immensely broad from shoulders to hips, awkward of gait, long armed, and bowlegged, this great German has won his place in baseball by his uncanny ability to hit the ball harder and more often than any living man.</p>\n<p>Hans is no moving picture either in the field or at bat, but once he connects with the ball he becomes a human whirlwind. National League pitchers dream about him and call it a nightmare. The lucky man who strikes him out receives an ovation, for he has done something.</p>\n<p>The only ball which worries Hans is the spit ball. He does not care for the wet ones, but they are all alike after he hits them. One of the spit ball artists of the National League has this to say about Wagner:</p>\n<p>\"He'll hit anything anywhere. No pitcher ever scares him. He may hate to see you wetting that ball and when you say to him:</p>\n<p>\"'This is IT, you big Dutchman!' his eyes will get about as big as butter plates, but if he hits it! GOOD NIGHT!\"</p>\n<p><b>THE MOST SENSATIONAL OF ALL</b></p>\n<p>The most sensational play ever made? Every fan will give a different answer to this question. Some will say that Chase made it when he saved a game by racing into the middle of the diamond on a pop fly, reaching the ball when it was only a few inches from the grass. Ed Walsh, the Chicago White Sox pitcher, thinks it was made at Detroit two years ago.</p>\n<p>It happened in the game in which Walsh broke the Detroit hoodoo. The Tigers had beaten Walsh every time he faced them. They regarded him as their lawful prey. The game was played in Detroit, and Mullin, who started this season with eleven straight victories for the Tigers, was slated to pitch against Walsh.</p>\n<p>Early in the contest George Davis, the veteran shortstop of the Chicago club, secured the only hit made off Mullin and it was enough to win the game. The ball, driven down the first base line into right field, struck a fire hose lying in the grass and bounded into the bleachers for a home run. After that Mullin was invincible.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the game, Detroit opened with the usual rally. Rossman, Detroit's first baseman, leading off in the inning, smashed the ball against the fence for a clean triple. \"Dutch\" Schaefer drew a base on balls. Schmidt, next at bat, gave the hit-and-run sign and, with both runners in motion, hit a hard bounder down toward third base where Tannehill of Chicago was playing. Tannehill made a perfect scoop and threw the ball to the plate twenty feet ahead of Rossman, who seeing that he was caught, doubled back on the line, hoping to dodge the tag long enough to allow Schaefer to reach third.</p>\n<p>Sullivan raced down the line with the ball, driving Rossman before him. Rossman slipped and fell close to third base and just as Sullivan tagged him for the first out, Schaefer slid to third. In the meantime, Schmidt, a slow runner because of an injury to his ankle, had rounded first base and was well on his way to second. Sullivan straightened up and whipped the ball to Rohe who was covering second base and calling for the throw.</p>\n<p>As Schmidt slid, Rohe's arm came down with a thump and Schmidt made the second out. The instant Sullivan threw the ball, Schaefer was on his feet and dashing home from third base. The plate had been left unprotected; Sullivan was down near third base. Walsh, the pitcher, yelled for the ball and raced Schaefer to the rubber, closely followed by George Davis. The two runners collided in front of the plate.</p>\n<p>Walsh was stunned and Schaefer was thrown ten feet from the plate, alighting on his shoulders. Davis, who arrived about the same time, took the throw and dropped the ball on the struggling Tiger, completing the third out and the most sensational triple play ever made in the big leagues.</p>\n<p>George Davis, who is a scientist, says that it was not a clean triple, but every man at the ball park went home talking about it in whispers. It is the melodrama of the game which counts in the penciled statement of the autocrat of the box office.</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p>Robert Frost never felt more at home than when watching baseball, \"be it in park or sand lot.\" Full of heroism and heartbreak, the most beloved of American sports is also the most poetic, and writers have been drawn to this sports as no other. With <i>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</i>, The Library of America presents the story of the national adventure as revealed through the fascinating lens of the great American game. <p> Philip Roth considers the terrible thrill of the adolescent centerfielder; Richard Ford listens to minor-league baseball on the radio while driving cross-country; Amiri Baraka remembers the joy of watching the Newark Eagles play in the era before Jackie Robinson shattered the color line. Unforgettable portraits of legendary players who have become icons -- Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Hank Aaron -- are joined by glimpses of lesser-known characters such as the erudite Moe Berg, who could speak a dozen languages \"but couldn't hit in any of them.\" <p> Poems in <i>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</i> include indispensable works whose phrases have entered the language -- Ernest Thayer's \"Casey at the Bat\" and Franklin P. Adams's \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\" -- as well as more recent offerings from May Swenson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Martin Espada. Testimonies from classic oral histories offer insights into the players who helped enshrine the sport in the American imagination. Spot reporting by Heywood Broun and Damon Runyan stands side by side with journalistic profiles that match baseball legends with some of our finest writers: John Updike on Ted Williams, Gay Talese on Joe DiMaggio, Red Smith on Lefty Grove.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Dawidoff, the author of a well-regarded biography of Moe Berg (The Catcher Was a Spy), has assembled this collection of exemplary baseball writing. While acknowledging the literature's formative years with early boosters such as Albert Spalding and other \"dead ball\" era writers, he concentrates on its mature period, from Ring Lardner through the two Rogers (Kahn and Angell) of the modern era, even Don Delillo and Stephen King. Dawidoff smartly doesn't rule out a great piece of baseball writing merely because it's familiar: classics like Updike's account of Ted Williams's final 1960 game, Gay Talese's Esquire profile of the unknowable Joe DiMaggio, and W.C. Heinz's salute to the recklessly brave Pistol Pete Reiser belong in any anthology worth its pitching rosin. This wonderful introduction belongs alongside past collections such as The Armchair Guide to Baseball. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.</p>",

While acknowledging the literature's formative years with early boosters such as Albert Spalding and other \"dead ball\" era writers, he concentrates on its mature period, from Ring Lardner through the two Rogers (Kahn and Angell) of the modern era, even Don Delillo and Stephen King. Dawidoff smartly doesn't rule out a great piece of baseball writing merely because it's familiar: classics like Updike's account of Ted Williams's final 1960 game, Gay Talese's Esquire profile of the unknowable Joe DiMaggio, and W.C. Heinz's salute to the recklessly brave Pistol Pete Reiser belong in any anthology worth its pitching rosin. This wonderful introduction belongs alongside past collections such as The Armchair Guide to Baseball. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>An intelligently selected and diverse collection of the best baseball poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, to be published on opening day of the Major League season. Author, prolific magazine contributor, and former college shortstop Dawidoff (The Catcher Was a Spy, 1994) assembles excellent verse and prose about baseball for this long-overdue Library of America anthology. As he notes in his introduction, baseball has historically touched everyone who grew up in the US, and many of our best authors wrote about it; our national pastime, Dawidoff argues, has become an integral part of our literary landscape and American heritage. He makes a strong case for this idea by including verse by poets from Carl Sandburg and William Carlos Williams to Robert Frost and Marianne Moore. To further demonstrate the sport's cultural significance, Dawidoff includes prose from such preeminent novelists as Thomas Wolfe, Bernard Malamud, John Updike, and Annie Dillard. Additionally, he uncovers gems from the most unlikely sources: Stephen King produces a heartrending chronicle of his son's little league team's quest for the 1987 Main State Championship; Negro League legend Satchel Paige divulges his six rules for staying young. Dawidoff captures our history's tense and ambiguous racial undercurrents in excerpts from works like Amiri Baraka's The Autobiography of Leroi Jones. He demonstrates the enduring resonance of baseball fiction by showing that classics like Ernest Lawrence Thayer's \"Casey At the Bat\" and Ring Lardner's You Know Me Al hold their own when compared to modern baseball writing like Yusef Komunyakaa's poem \"Glory\" and Don DeLillo's Underworld. This collection resurrects scintillating fragments ofyouthful summers and ultimately convinces readers that reflecting on baseball helps us understand our complicated national identity. Of obvious appeal to baseball fans of all ages, but also a delight for general readers-and worthy of attention from scholars serious about American history and literature.\n\n</article>"

This new edition—including a new introduction and three new essays—remains a testament of Moraga's coming-of-age as a Chicana and a lesbian at a time when the political merging of those two identities was severely censured.</p>\n<p>Drawing on the Mexican legacy of Malinche, the symbolic mother of the first mestizo peoples, Moraga examines the collective sexual and cultural wounding suffered by women since the Conquest. Moraga examines her own mestiza parentage and the seemingly inescapable choice of assimilation into a passionless whiteness or uncritical acquiescence to the patriarchal Chicano culture she was raised to reproduce. By finding Chicana feminism and honoring her own sexuality and loyalty to other women of color, Moraga finds a way to claim both her family and her freedom.</p>\n<p>Moraga's new essays, written with a voice nearly a generation older, continue the project of \"loving in the war years,\" but Moraga's posture is now closer to that of a zen warrior than a street-fighter. In these essays, loving is an extended prayer, where the poet-politica reflects on the relationship between our small individual deaths and the dyings of nations of people (pueblos). <i>Loving</i> is an angry response to the \"cultural tyranny\" of the mainstream art world and a celebration of the strategic use of \"cultural memory\" in the creation of an art of resistance.</p>\n<p><b>Cherríe Moraga</b> is the co-editor of the classic feminist anthology <i>This Bridge Called My Back</i> and the author of <i>The Last Generation.</i> She is Artist-in-Residence at Stanford University.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p><b>SPOOFS<br>\n</b>WOLCOTT GIBBS DEATH IN THE RUMBLE SEAT WITH THE USUAL APOLOGIES TO ERNEST HEMINGWAY,<br>\nWHO MUST BE PRETTY SICK OF THIS SORT OF THING Most people don’t like the pedestrian part, and it is best not to look at that if you can help it. But if you can’t help seeing them, long-legged and their faces white, and then the shock and the car lifting up a little on one side, then it is best to think of it as something very unimportant but beautiful and necessary artistically. It is unimportant because the people who are pedestrians are not very important, and if they were not being cogido by automobiles it would just be something else. And it is beautiful and necessary because, without the possibility of somebody getting cogido, driving a car would be just like anything else. It would be like reading “Thanatopsis,” which is neither beautiful nor necessary, but hogwash. If you drive a car, and don’t like the pedestrian part, then you are one of two kinds of people. Either you haven’t very much vitality and you ought to do something about it, or else you are yellow and there is nothing to be done about it at all.</p>\n<p>If you don’t know anything about driving cars you are apt to think a driver is good just because he goes fast. This may be very exciting at first, but afterwards there is a bad taste in the mouth and the feeling of dishonesty. Ann Bender, the American, drove as fast on the Merrick Road as anybody I have ever seen, but when cars came the other way she always worked out of their terrain and over in the ditch so that you never had the hard, clean feeling of danger, but only bumping up and down in the ditch, and sometimes hitting your head on the top of the car. Good drivers go fast too, but it is always down the middle of the road, so that cars coming the other way are dominated, and have to go in the ditch themselves. There are a great many ways of getting the effect of danger, such as staying in the middle of the road till the last minute and then swerving out of the pure line, but they are all tricks, and afterwards you know they were tricks, and there is nothing left but disgust.</p>\n<p>The cook: I am a little tired of cars, sir. Do you know any stories?</p>\n<p>I know a great many stories, but I’m not sure that they’re suitable.</p>\n<p>The cook: The hell with that.</p>\n<p>Then I will tell you the story about God and Adam and naming the animals. You see, God was very tired after he got through making the world. He felt good about it, but he was tired so he asked Adam if he’d mind thinking up names for the animals.</p>\n<p>“What animals?” Adam said.</p>\n<p>“Those,” God said.</p>\n<p>“Do they have to have names?” Adam said.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a name, haven’t you?” God said.</p>\n<p>I could see–</p>\n<p>The cook: How do you get into this?</p>\n<p>Some people always write in the first person, and if you do it’s very hard to write any other way, even when it doesn’t altogether fit into the context. If you want to hear this story, don’t keep interrupting.</p>\n<p>The cook: O.K.</p>\n<p>I could see that Adam thought God was crazy, but he didn’t say anything. He went over to where the animals were, and after a while he came back with the list of names.</p>\n<p>“Here you are,” he said.</p>\n<p>God read the list, and nodded.<br>\n“They’re pretty good,” he said. “They’re all pretty good except that last one.”</p>\n<p>“That’s a good name,” Adam said. “What’s the matter with it?”</p>\n<p>“What do you want to call it an elephant for?,” God said.</p>\n<p>Adam looked at God.</p>\n<p>“It looks like an elephant to me,” he said.</p>\n<p>The cook: Well?</p>\n<p>That’s all.</p>\n<p>The cook: It is a very strange story, sir.</p>\n<p>It is a strange world, and if a man and a woman love each other, that is strange too, and what is more, it always turns out badly.</p>\n<p>In the golden age of car-driving, which was about 1910, the sense of impending disaster, which is a very lovely thing and almost nonexistent, was kept alive in a number of ways. For one thing, there was always real glass in the windshield so that if a driver hit anything, he was very definitely and beautifully cogido. The tires weren’t much good either, and often they’d blow out before you’d gone ten miles. Really, the whole car was built that way. It was made not only so that it would precipitate accidents but so that when the accidents came it was honestly vulnerable, and it would fall apart, killing all the people with a passion that was very fine to watch. Then they began building the cars so that they would go much faster, but the glass and the tires were all made so that if anything happened it wasn’t real danger, but only the false sense of it. You could do all kinds of things with the new cars, but it was no good because it was all planned in advance. Mickey Finn, the German, always worked very far into the other car’s terrain so that the two cars always seemed to be one. Driving that way he often got the faender, or the clicking when two cars touch each other in passing, but because you knew that nothing was really at stake it was just an empty classicism, without any value because the insecurity was all gone and there was nothing left but a kind of mechanical agility. It is the same way when any art gets into its decadence. It is the same way about s-x–</p>\n<p>The cook: I like it very much better when you talk about s-x, sir, and I wish you would do it more often.<br>\nI have talked a lot about s-x before, and now I thought I would talk about something else.</p>\n<p>The cook: I think that is very unfortunate, sir, because you are at your best with s-x, but when you talk about automobiles you are just a nuisance.</p>",

Harmon enhances each entry with pertinent information about the work and the poet; his insight adds much to the enjoyment of the collection. The selections are taken from the ninth edition of The Columbia Granger's Index to Poetry , chosen because 400 contemporary editors, critics, and poets included them most often in their own anthologies. ``The Poems in Order of Popularity'' concludes the book. Easy-to-read print with a look of fine calligraphy on high-quality paper add to the appeal.-- Arlene Hoebel, W. T. Woodson High School, Fairfax, VA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booknews</h4>The pop title is right out of Billboard (the publisher must think poetry needs all the crossover it can get), but the collection is quite terrific--not necessarily the greatest poems (best to avoid that can of worms), but the 500 English-language poems that have appealed most often to 400 contemporary editors, critics, and poets for inclusion in their own widely disparate anthologies, which were indexed in the Ninth Edition of The Columbia Granger's Index to Poetry. From the famous pre-Chaucerian, Anonymous (c.1250-c.1350), author of \"Cuckoo Song\", to Plath and Ginsberg, the only problem with this anthology will be putting it down. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>From The Critics</h4>In the introduction, Harmon boldly proclaims, \"This is it!\" He is right. The task he set for himself was to compile an anthology with which anyone could start to gain a familiarity with poetry in English. He has nobly done yeoman's work in selecting and commenting upon the 500 poems that have been anthologized most often, based on the 400 collections indexed in the ninth edition of \"The Columbia Granger's Index to Poetry\". Harmon is a professor of English at the University of North Carolina and edited \"The Concise Columbia Book of Poetry\" and the \"Oxford Book of American Light Verse\". He also coedited the fifth edition of \"A Handbook to Literature\" Represented in \"The Top 500 Poems\" are 160 poets. Shakespeare has 29 entries. Anonymous has 21, Donne has 19, Blake has 18, and Dickinson and Yeats each have 14. Harmon justifies the fact that \"three-quarters of the poems are British . . . because British poetry has been with us three times as long as American poetry.\" Coverage spans six centuries, ranging from Chaucer in the Middle Ages to Allen Ginsberg and Sylvia Plath. The nineteenth century contributed the greatest number of poems 169, with the twentieth century second with 122 The format is attractive. The paper is of high quality, margins are wide, and the poetry is in dark, readable print. Each poet is introduced with a short paragraph in small print with just enough data to pique curiosity. Comments by Harmon, in yet a different font, follow the selections. He writes with a sly sense of humor, describing alliteration as \"sliding along the slippery slope of selfsame sounds.\" The entries for poets are in chronological order, and a detailed table of contents and a name index provide additional access points. An index of titles and first lines is included, as well as an appendix that ranks the poems according to the number of times they have been anthologized All types of libraries will be interested in this volume as a basic anthology of poetry in English. It will be welcome in elementary and secondary school library media centers, public library poetry and reference collections, home libraries, and as a gift. If your library can buy only one volume of poetry, let this be it.\n\n</article>"

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4><p>Schechter (American literature, Queens Coll., CUNY; <i>The Devil's Gentleman: Privilege, Poison, and the Trial That Ushered in the Twentieth Century</i> ) has put together a sweeping anthology covering the history of crime in America and showcasing some of the best American crime writing. Arranged by publication date, the selections are mostly magazine-length retellings of American crimes, including Puritan execution sermons, murder ballads, and cringe-worthy heinous accounts. The authors selected vary from the colonial (e.g., Benjamin Franklin) to the literary (e.g., Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Truman Capote) to current best-selling experts (e.g., Dominick Dunne, Ann Rule, Calvin Trillin, James Ellroy). The all-too-familiar tales are here-Leopold and Loeb, Charles Manson, Son of Sam-but Schechter also includes some stories that received less press and may be new to readers, like the 1930s case of the Cleveland \"butcher\" and the 1873 axe murders on Smutty Nose Island, NH. Readers will find it difficult to put down this delightful treasury encompassing some of the best crime writing from colonial times to today. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries.-Karen Sandlin Silverman, Library Svcs., Ctr. for Applied Research, Philadelphia</p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>The Barnes & Noble Review</h4>If people read detective fiction to see justice done, they read true crime stories in order to see innocence lost. From Edgar Allan Poe (who invented the detective genre) to Arthur Conan Doyle (whose Sherlock Holmes proved its greatest popularizer) through to today's assortment of imaginary private and public investigators, fictional detective stories center on the heroic ingenuity of the detective, whose guts, guile, and guiding intelligence result in a solution that is -- for entertainment's sake -- typically counterintuitive and unpredictable. The detective outwits the criminal and justice is served. \n<p>The true-crime story, on the other hand, is rarely puzzle-like. Real-life detecting is a more prosaic business. Murder is handled by the police, and they usually figure out whodunit pretty quickly. The allure of true-crime stories lies elsewhere, for they are about the victims and the criminals. The victims begin in a state of innocence, and the criminals arrive to wreck that innocence forever. Because the story is true, the reader can readily identify with the victims and share their entry into the world of violent experience, where malevolent -- and fascinating -- murderers walk the earth.</p>\n<p><em>True Crime,</em> Harold Schechter's masterful anthology from the Library of America, showcases lost innocence through American time and space, ranging from the New England colonies to contemporary Beverly Hills. Choosing from a vast universe of true crime stories, Schechter divides his focus. Some of his selections spotlight famous cases, such as the legendary unsolved Black Dahlia murder of 1947, in which the shockingly tortured corpse of a young woman rattled -- and riveted -- Los Angeles. Schechter also brings our attention back to famous criminals like Ed Gein, whose grisly exploits inspired first <em>Psycho</em> and then <em>The Silence of the Lambs,</em> and Son of Sam, whose random killings terrorized New York City in 1977. Other chapters call attention to the work of famous writers who aren't necessarily known for true-crime writing, such as Mark Twain, Frank Norris, or the poet José Martí. And of course there are famous writers covering well-known cases, such as Damon Runyon reporting on the notorious case of Ruth Snyder and her lover, Judd Gray, who were convicted of murdering Mrs. Snyder's husband in 1927. Their trial is little remembered today -- one of the many attractions of Schechter's anthology lies in its recovery of crimes once famous but now forgotten -- but the Snyder-Gray trial was a cause c&amp;eacutelèbre of its time and the inspiration for James M. Cain's <em>Double Indemnity,</em> a 1936 novel later adapted by Billy Wilder into one of the all-time great films noirs.</p>\n<p>Roughly speaking, <em>True Crime</em> traces how crime reportage expanded from the realm of religious instruction to enter tabloid journalism, and finally to become literature. Schechter's excellent introduction, augmented by headnotes to each chapter, shows how American true-crime writing originated in New England as part of the \"execution sermon.\" Delivered next to the scaffold as part of the hanging ritual, the execution sermon was a disquisition meant to instruct the assembled multitudes. This collection contains no actual examples of this type of oration, but it does include Cotton Mather's <em>Pillars of Salt,</em> a remarkable 1699 compilation drawn from the tradition. Like other Puritan genres (such as the captivity narrative), true crime writing turned both secular and sensational over time, broadening its focus to encompass the prurient as well as the didactic. (Both of these preoccupations have endured to the present day, as Schechter's selection from the prolific and popular Ann Rule, among others, amply shows.) When writers began striving for genuine literary effect, a development this anthology allows us to chart from its beginnings, the modern style of true crime writing had arrived.</p>\n<p>The best pieces in <em>True Crime</em> showcase detailed character development of either victims or criminals. Celia Thaxter's account of an 1873 multiple murder on a New Hampshire island stands out for its filigreed portrait of innocent victims whose simple lives are destroyed, for example, while Miriam Allen DeFord's delicate anatomy of the infamous 1924 thrill killers Leopold and Loeb stands out for its attention to the psychology of the criminal, in effect answering the question, \"Why would anyone do such a thing?\" (A. J. Liebling's gripping 1955 reenactment of how a clever young newspaper reporter cracked a murder case in 1898 stands out in the collection for its striking resemblance to an invented detective story; its singularity demonstrates how the narrative conventions governing true crime differ from those of crime fiction.)</p>\n<p>What makes people kill other people who have done nothing to them? This question lies at the heart of true-crime writing, and it takes a variety of forms over the history of the genre. The Puritan minister asks the murderer on the way to the gallows if he knows that he has a \"<em>Wicked Nature</em> in [him], full of Enmity against all that is <em>Holy, and Just, and Good</em>\"? Two and a half centuries later, Elizabeth Hardwick observes that \"it is not hard to understand organized crime, but how can you understand two young boys who kill an old couple in their candy store for a few dollars?\" Modern true-crime writing focuses alternately on the hypothetical couple whose lives are destroyed, and on the two young killers and their murderous kin.</p>\n<p>If <em>True Crime</em> has a weakness, it is only that this excellent anthology can't encompass the book-length stories that have raised the literary reputation of true crime writing during the last two generations. Truman Capote's <em>In Cold Blood</em> shaped the modern form of the genre, while Vincent Bugliosi's <em>Helter Skelter,</em> Joe McGinness's <em>Fatal Vision,</em> and Norman Mailer's <em>The Executioner's Song</em> are a few of the superb books that helped bring true crime to its current heights -- partly because the longer format allows for a deeper exploration of the lives and personalities of victims and criminals and a more detailed portrait of their communities. <em>True Crime</em> richly satisfies on its own terms, and it is to the lasting credit of both the book and its editor that this anthology will undoubtedly send its readers in the direction of the great books that helped to inspire it. --<i>Leonard Cassuto</i></p>\n<p><i>Leonard Cassuto is a professor of English at Fordham University and the author of</i> Hard-Boiled Sentimentality: The Secret History of American Crime Stories. <i>He can be found on the web at www.lcassuto.com.</i></p>\n\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p>\"I am not my breast, and I am not cancer; they are only pieces of who I am. What is my heart like, am I kind, strong, loving, compassionate. . . . Those are the things that count.\" <br><br>I Am Not My Breast Cancer gathers the warm, loving, frank, and informed voices of more than 800 women-from every state in the nation and from continents as far away as Australia and Africa-who reveal their fears, trade advice, share experiences, and express their deepest, most intimate concerns. Nothing before this groundbreaking book has captured the real experience of breast cancer. It is essential reading for any woman with this diagnosis. <br><br>I Am Not My Breast Cancer offers women the companionship of other women dealing with this disease. Ruth Peltason, who has twice undergone treatment for breast cancer, has woven their stories together while maintaining the authenticity of their voices. These are ordinary women dealing with this cancer and its many ramifications. They range in age from their early twenties to their late seventies. They are the collective face of breast cancer today. Their comments are moving, sometimes funny, always honest. They speak out on every topic, from lovemaking and intimacy to losing their hair, from juggling the day-to-day realities of being a patient, mother, wife, and coworker to the overwhelming worries about their own mortality. Remarkably, they emerge with grace and optimism and a determination not to be defined by disease. <br><br>Taking the reader chronologically through the stages of diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and self-discovery, I Am Not My Breast Cancer offers women a deeper understanding of themselves and living with cancer. As Peltason writes inher introduction, \"My greatest wish for this book is that it offer comfort to any woman living with breast cancer and to those who care about her. If this book is kept on the bedside table, then I hope its need is brief and its impact lasting. I Am Not My Breast Cancer speaks of courage, heroism in deeds small and large, and incredible faith and fortitude.\" <br><br>\"You can live without a breast. You cannot say the same for the human heart.\"</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Peltason, an editor and breast cancer survivor, founded and hosted the \"First Person Plural\" Web site project, an online forum for women facing the disease. Their dialogue provides the content for this book, culled from the entries of 800 women across the U.S. and around the world. Peltason organizes the material into three general parts: \"Diagnosis,\" \"Living with Breast Cancer\" and \"The Big Picture,\" with such subtopics as \"Sharing the News,\" \"Being Womanly\" and \"Anniversaries and Milestones.\" Participants use screen names for privacy, approaching their disease with candor and freely discussing their feelings about their bodies and their relationships. At times, those overcome by anger and fear far outweigh those with a bright outlook, but when these survivors \"look in the mirror\" at the conclusion of the text, many envision a hopeful future. Perhaps the most poignant entries are from younger women, some of whom have been driven into early menopause and infertility by chemotherapy. Although this is an informative book, some survivors may discover that these raw entries churn up disturbing emotions; others will find comfort in these voices, and in the knowledge that they aren't alone-either in their sorrow or in their strength and courage. <I>(Feb.)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p>Preface For more than three decades, students and instructors have relied on the McMichael-Leonard Anthology of American Literature as a reliable source of literary texts, annotations, and contextual information. The McMichael-Leonard anthology has secured its reputation with a solid core of writers and works and has enhanced that reputation with quality ancillaries, including the Pick-a-Penguin Program, American Literature Database, and text-specific MyLiteratureKitTM. Because it allows such flexibility in meeting individual course needs, Anthology of American Literature is a complete American Literature resource. In preparing this tenth edition, the editors have continued to follow the principles of selection that have made the previous editions so successful: selected works primarily for their literary significance. represented authors by offering extensive samplings of their works. included, where possible, long works in their entirety. provided clear, concise, and informative introductions and headnotes that are appropriate for student readers. explained unfamiliar terms and allusions through in-text references and footnotes. presented author bibliographies that are selective and current. Authors and works in the anthology follow a generally chronological order. In deciding on a standard text from among the various editions available for selections, we have chosen, whenever possible, that edition most respected by modern scholars. The text reprinted is identified at the end of the headnote for each author. Spelling and punctuation are, in some instances, regularized and modernized to correct obvious errors and to suit the reader¿s convenience. An editorial excision of less than one paragraph is indicated by an ellipsis (. . .); excisions of a paragraph or more are indicated by a centered ellipsis: . . . New to the Tenth Edition Building on the anthology¿s solid foundation, we were in this edition able to make important enhancements to content and format: We have updated and revised period introductions and headnotes. We have included new headnotes and selections for the following authors: Ebenezer Cooke, Sarah Kemble Knight, Royall Tyler, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, and E. D. E. N. Southworth. We have added new works or expanded existing ones by Roger Williams, Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Samuel Sewall, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, William Apess, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Frances E. W. Harper, and Walt Whitman. We have added new ¿Reading the Historical Context¿ selections by ¿lvar N¿¿ez Cabeza De Vaca, Benjamin Banneker, Thomas Jefferson, and Stephen A. Douglas. We have supplemented the ¿Reading the Critical Context¿ section already included for The Literature of the Early- to Mid-Nineteenth Century by creating equivalent sections for both The Literature of Early America and The Literature of the Eighteenth Century. We have added new ¿Critical Context¿ selections by John Dryden, Alexander Pope, and Benjamin Franklin. We have restored the 1881 version of Walt Whitman¿s Song of Myself, as the version most suitable for classroom use. We have continued the anthology¿s revamping of the treatment of Native American authors, moving away from the ¿myths and legends¿ motif and toward an emphasis on specifically identifiable speakers and authors firmly anchored in the historical context¿including the addition of works by William Apess and Tecumseh. In addition, we have restored Din¿ahane': The Navajo Creation Story to The Literature of Early America. We have for the first time included visual images related to specific literary works and to the general historical and literary contexts of the various periods. Anthology of American Literature also offers design features that make it more accessible to students. The typeface for the headnotes and the literary selections is easy to read. Updated chronological charts offer students at-a-glance information about authors¿ lives and works, as well as key historical, political, technological, and cultural contexts.

In presenting a more inclusive canon of American literature, THE HEATH ANTHOLOGY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE&#58; VOLUME D&#58; MODERN PERIOD (1910-1945), 6th Edition continues to balance the traditional, leading names in American literature with lesser-known writers and to build upon the anthology's other strengths&#58; its apparatus and its ancillaries. Available in five volumes for greater flexibility, the 6th Edition offers thematic clusters to stimulate classroom discussions and showcase the treatment of important topics across the genres.</p>",

This well-selected volume of New York poems, conceived in the days following September 11, 2001, includes not only the tried-and-true anthology pieces but an assortment of excellent lesser-known poems; we're reminded that in New York all things end \"Too soon! Too soon!\" (as Ferlinghetti exclaimed), although the city's sophisticated residents will murmur only \"It gets so terribly late\" (Elizabeth Bishop, teasing a friend). There are some stirring September 11th elegies here, but Whitman's words speak most consolingly, across the century, to the city's new sense of strength imperilled: \"It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, / The dark threw its patches down upon me also.\"</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Adam  Kirsch</h4>Poems of New York, a new entry in the Everyman’s Library Pocket Poets series, succeeds extraordinarily well in capturing the major strands of New York poetry. Part of the charm of the book is simply in the details, the familiar things transformed by metaphor.<br>\n—<i>The New York Observer</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>The New Yorker</h4>In 1811, city planners unveiled the urban grid that would become the New York we know; not long afterward, the city's first poet, Walt Whitman, came along to chronicle its particular nexus of enthusiasm, expansiveness, and elegant ennui.

Selected and edited by Open City contributing editor and New York Times Book Review poetry reviewer Elizabeth Schmidt, the more than 125 poems here tend toward less familiar works from familiar names. Instead of Frank O'Hara's \"A Step Away from Them\" we get \"Steps\" (\"all I want is a room up there/ and you in it\") though Auden's \"September 1, 1939\" and Williams's famous \"The Great Figure\" the figure `5' glimpsed on a fire truck are here. As Schmidt notes in her introduction, \"Poets who have written about New York are masters at preserving, and allowing us to cherish, moments of life in this theater of chance and change.\"\n\n</article>"

    "synopsis": "<p><P>In the tradition of Alice Walker, this electrifying new African American voice delivers the verdict on the urban condition in a sensual, propulsive, and prophetic book of poetry and prose. <br><br>Whether she is writing about an enraged teenager gone &quot;wilding&quot; in Central Park, fifteen-year-old Latasha Harlins gunned down by a Korean grocer, or a brutalized child who grows up to escape her probable fate through the miracle of art, Sapphire's vision in this collection of poetry and prose is unswervingly honest.<br><br>&quot;Stunning . . . . One of the strongest debut collections of the '90s.&quot;&#151;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In one of the strongest debut collections of the 90s, this black lesbian feminist presents a fusion of poetry and prose, interspersed with short stories. Not for the squeamish, Sapphire's imagery is so fierce that readers will want to spread out the book over several sittings. Accounts of a young girl's rape by her father frame and inform all else, but Sapphire draws in irony as a buffer: in one extremely vivid poem, familiar phrases from the Mickey Mouse Club alternate with memories of assault. Early in her career, this writer felt the need to tell the stories of all victims (Tawana Brawley, the Central Park jogger, a nameless woman she meets on the bus), but to accomplish this she must adopt their emotional horrors as her own. ``Now that you know, / you can begin / to heal,'' the first poem ends. It is this commitment to human sensitivity that makes the terrifying exploits described here palatable. It also permits the narrator, 80 pages later, to describe the grief she feels at her mother's deathbed. Perfectly paced, sidestepping explication, Sapphire's words provide pointers to her characters' dramas, but she's still capable of stunning readers with a final image. (Feb.)</p>",

(Feb.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>These riveting vignettes--some are poems, others short prose works--offer a real voice speaking on topics too often distorted by media hype: sexual abuse, prostitution, racial and sexual violence, lesbian love, and mother-daughter relations. In spite of a tendency toward cliche, the confessional pieces included here are painful and affecting; their explicit, sordid detail is utterly convincing, and the author's intelligence allows her to generalize beyond personal anger and pain. Dramatizations of such public events as the Central Park wilding incident and the Los Angeles shooting of a black teenager by a Korean American grocer, however, seem merely descriptive and sensational. This is volatile stuff, and not all of it works, but the pieces that do, go over with a bang. Recommended.-- Ellen Kaufman, Dewey Ballantine Law Lib., New York\n\n</article>"

The chronology begins with William Wells Brown's The Escape: or, a Leap for Freedom, based on his own life as an escaped slave. Two expatriot authors, Ira Aldridge and Victor Sejour, provide glimpses of life in Europe, while at home, playwrights struggled with the issues of birth control, miscegenation, lynching, and migration. The book embraces both commercial successes such as George C.

The stylistic range, too, runs the gamut of genre from the realism of Ted Ward, Lonne Elder III, and Ed Bullins to the surrealism of Marita Bonner and Aishah Rahman.

    "overview": "<p>Transcendentalism was the first major intellectual movement in U.S. history, championing the inherent divinity of each individual, as well as the value of collective social action. In the mid-nineteenth century, the movement took off, changing how Americans thought about religion, literature, the natural world, class distinctions, the role of women, and the existence of slavery.<br>\nEdited by the eminent scholar Lawrence Buell, this comprehensive anthology contains the essential writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and their fellow visionaries. There are also reflections on the movement by Charles Dickens, Henry James, Walt Whitman, Louisa May Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. This remarkable volume introduces the radical innovations of a brilliant group of thinkers whose impact on religious thought, social reform, philosophy, and literature continues to reverberate in the twenty-first century.</p>",
    "excerpt": "<p>1.</p>\n<p>Mary Moody Emerson</p>\n<p>Letters to a Future Transcendentalist</p>\n<p>(1817—51)</p>\n<p>Mary Moody Emerson (1774-1863) was Ralph Waldo Emerson's aunt and first mentor. She was a striking figure in her own right. She impressed all who came into contact with her—which included most of the Transcendentalist circle—with her unsystematic brilliance, her spiritual intensity, her biting wit, and her eccentric force. The younger sister of Emerson's father, she became the family matriarch after his early death. She had high hopes that Ralph Waldo would distinguish himself in the ministerial career that the men in his family had pursued for six unbroken generations back to colonial times. She wound up driving him toward Transcendentalism even as she tried to warn him away.</p>\n<p>The many letters she sent him over more than forty years display her unique talents. They led Emerson, astonishingly, to praise her as one of the great prose stylists of her day, although she wrote almost nothing for publication. Both of them relished their correspondence. Many of Mary Emerson's turns of thought and even her turns of phrase resurface in his own later essays. They took a similar delight in the natural world, in ranging widely through Asian as well as western thought and literature, in moral and spiritual inquiry, and in a headlong free-associative style of thought and expression.</p>\n<p>Here are a dozen passages from Mary's letters to her nephew, starting with a comically extravagant letter of congratulation upon the start of his freshman year at Harvard at the tender but then typical age of fourteen. Often she responds pointedly to his own letters and compositions, from a juvenile proposal for \"reform\" of drama through high-minded literary criticism (item 4) to major work like his 1838 Divinity School Address (item 11), which took her aback, as it did most of his elders. Mary's oblique reflection on the controversy, her fable of Urah, may have suggested Emerson's poem \"Uriel\" (see Section V-B below).</p>\n<p>Too conservative to approve of Waldo's Transcendental turn, Mary Emerson nonetheless helped set him—and the movement—on the way. But no matter how famous he became, she never ceased to admonish him when she thought he deserved it. Her charge that wealth was a topic unworthy of him (item 12) is a prime example.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: The Selected Letters of Mary Moody Emerson, ed. Nancy Craig Simmons. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1993. Spelling as well as punctuation of these letters have been partially normalized for the sake of readability.</p>\n<p>(1)</p>\n<p>What dull Prosaic Muse would venture from the humble dell of an unlettered district, to address a son of Harvard? . . . In that great Assembly, where human nature is purified from its native dross &amp; ignorance, may the name of my dear Waldo be inrolled.</p>\n<p>[NOVEMBER 4, 1817]</p>\n<p>(2)</p>\n<p>The spirits of inspiration are abroad tonight. I have rode only to go out &amp; see the wonderous aspect of nature. . . . We love nature—to individuate ourselves in her wildest moods; to partake of her extension, &amp; glow with her colors &amp; fly on her winds; but we better love to cast her off and rely on that only which is imperishable. Shakespeare has admirably described the universal influence of the infinite Spirit by that of the sun, whose light &amp; warmth brings to maturity the healthiest plant &amp; the most poisonous—corrupts the corruptible, &amp; nourishes the splendid tribe of flora with the same beam. What an illustration—and of what a truth! . . . Right and wrong have had claims prior to all rites—immutable &amp; eternal in their nature . . . [JANUARY 18, 1821]</p>\n<p>(3)</p>\n<p>I have been fortunate this week to find a Visitor here from India, well versed in its literature &amp; theology. He showed us some fine representations of the incarnation of Vishnoo. They are much akin to Grecian fable—and from his representation I believe the incarnations to be much like the doctrine of transmigration. At bottom of the histories of the incarnations is often the doctrine of the universal presence &amp; agency of One God. . . .</p>\n<p>As to books, I've been only where you have, sometimes in Merlin's cave and Homer's shades, sometimes. Was delighted with the speech made by Ulysses to the shade of his mother. [Alexander] Pope's—is it better in original? Have been surprised to find in the 10th book of [the Roman poet] Juvenal some lines very like to the concluding ones of [Samuel] Johnson's \"Vanity of Human Wishes.\" Could Johnson have borrowed from the heathen? [MAY 24, 1822]</p>\n<p>(4)</p>\n<p>. . . As to words &amp; languages being so important—I will have nothing of it. The images, the sweet immortal images are within us—born there, our native right, and sometimes one kind of sounding word or syllable wakens the instrument of our souls and sometimes another. But we are not slaves to sense any more than to political usurpers, but by fashion &amp; imbecility. Aye, if I understand you, so you think.</p>\n<p>In the zeal of writing I began with the last sentence of your letter, &amp; have just read backwards till I am now for the first time in cool possession of the whole letter—Glad to hear you complain of fine splendid expressions without proportionate fine thoughts. But not that in order to judge you must read all the pieces or rather that you intend a reform which will oblige you to go thro' such bogs &amp; fens &amp; sloughs of passion &amp; crime. . . . And to me who am, if possible, more ignorant on the history &amp; character of the Drama than any other subject, it seems a less usefull exercise as it respects the reformer than any scientific or literary pursuit. [JUNE 26, 1822]</p>\n<p>(5)</p>\n<p>. . . Would to God thou wert ambitious—respected thyself more &amp; the world less. Thou wouldst not to Cambridge [to enroll at Harvard Divinity School.] . . . It is but a garnished sepulchre where may be found some relics of the body of Jesus—some grosser parts which he took not at his ascent . . . [NOVEMBER 7, 1824]</p>\n<p>(6)</p>\n<p>It is worse than idle to ridicule the fall—unless you can account for the origin of evil. . . . The apple may be allegorical—but if it were real it answered for a sign, an arbitrary one, be sure, of a government disciplinary &amp; perspective. The principle of obedience is the first in education—and the more trifling the object the more important the danger of defection. . . . Evil must have a beginning. If it were eternal—! What should we infer—that eternal right was coeval with—&amp; implied in its opposite? . . . Well, one &amp; all have the subject in the dark where God intended. And I never talk of the fall nor think of it—for the difficulties are too great. [JULY 8, 1827]</p>\n<p>(7)</p>\n<p>Would I could die today that this aching sense of immortality might be satisfied or cease to ache. The difficulty remains the same when I struggle with the extension of never never never—just as I repeated the exercise in childhood: cant form an idea, cant stretch myself to that which has no end. It may be owing to the limits of childhood repeating the idea &amp; wishing to come at an end in vain. . . . It is this impossibility of losing oneself, tho' ages pass over the change, that argues immortality. [SEPTEMBER 9, 1827]</p>\n<p>(8)</p>\n<p>My thanks for the sensibility you express at my being hurt to be thought by you distraught. But after all I do appear so to other folks, when under the influence of the indifference I feel to society (or somthing worse) with the extreme pleasure of wittnessing their fine things. The fears which I read in the countenance of my family lead me to act more independently than I should, if I were coaxed with their confidence. . . . You have borne with my outre manners and protected them better than any youth. Only forgive me greater &amp; worser defects of character—and these which pass away with the discordant humours of the body are of no import. [MAY 2, 1828]</p>\n<p>(9)</p>\n<p>Let us not complain of calvinism—its most terrible points are better than nothing. If the bible is a fable I would cherish it now in age with undying zeal—It may have a truth of infinite weight like other fables which have a little. But it is not a fable I know. It answers to the living consciousness of God's impress on the soul. It develops the divinity within. Not the poetic gospelless divinity of German idealism—whose baseless fabrick will vanish into thin air. [AUGUST (?) 1829]</p>\n<p>(10)</p>\n<p>You most beloved of ministers, who seemed formed by face, manner &amp; pen to copy &amp; illustrate the noblest of all institutions, are you at war with that angelic office? . . . And I may ask what you mean by speaking of \"a great truth whose authority you would feel as its own\"? In the letter of Dec 25 you [write] \"whether the heart were not the Creator.\" Now if this withering Lucifer doctrine of pantheism be true, what moral truth can you preach or by what authority should you feel it? Without a personal God you are on an ocean mast unrigged for any port or object. Then why not continue to preach—&amp; pray too? Where is the truth, so infinitely weighty with the true theist, injured? Some body must keep up these idle institutions &amp; they may keep men from jail and gallows. What better scope for the intellectual reservoir? And such has been your integrity, whenever I have been indulged with hearing or reading, what St Paul, who had the fullest convictions of Jesus being the only medium of communication with the Incomprehensible, would not tax your sincerity, tho' he would regret the different character you assigned. Pardon me if I declaim with the garrulity of age.</p>\n<p>[FEBRUARY 1832]</p>\n<p>(11)</p>\n<p>I love to gaze after the illuminati. . . . Yet believe with Burke that no improvement can be expected in the great truths &amp; institutions of morality and religion. And I lost my inquiries in thinking of the fabled Urah, who belonging to the coterie of Plato, was sent down by that high person . . . to reform a certain district and give it some utopian ornaments—so dully progressive so sober &amp; stale that in his disgust he breathed a fire which consumed every old land mark—tore up the moss-covered mounds; and the very altars which had been the refuge of the poor &amp; sinfull &amp; decrepit instead of being bettered were almost demolished—and in the destruction it is said that the wings of the spiritual vehicle were so scorched that he was forced to ask aid of a disciple of the old reforming Patriarch who was buried on some old loved spot, and he, tho' looked on as a very plodder, constructed a chariot of clouds which conveyed the messenger home to new fledge his wings. And the story goes, that when they were in action again he visited the same place &amp; found it overrun with barbarism &amp; governed by an ugly Radicale. [SEPTEMBER 1838?]</p>\n<p>(12)</p>\n<p>Wealth my dear Waldo: how could you—you gifted to rouse the interior to make even Christians think &amp; feel at certain high sentiments—how, under what illusion, could you lecture to Concord of its advantages? You sap the foundations of all that is great &amp; independant. Oh send the young to Brothels &amp; intemperance. . . . You who have steadily stood for the rights of the slave are riveting his chains &amp; pursuing the fugitive with increasing the rage the mania for wealth. Were you poor (and the papers speak of your high taxes) what a beautifull vision you might have drawn of its baseless fabrick while you awakened charity in its depths and glory. Forgive me if I offend, &amp; send me the lecture.</p>\n<p>[FEBRUARY 1851]</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</p>\n<p>Reason Versus Understanding</p>\n<p>(1825, 1829)</p>\n<p>Coleridge (1772-1834) was a leading British Romantic poet and one of the most inventive critical thinkers of his age. Along with Thomas Carlyle, he was more influential in interpreting German thought for American audiences than any other early-nineteenth-century British writer. A prime example is Coleridge's restatement of the Kantian distinction between \"Reason\" and \"Understanding,\" in the face of the prevailing Anglo-American view, which rested on John Locke's contention that all knowledge is derived empirically, from sense experience. In Locke's view, reason and understanding were synonymous. Coleridge prepared the way for the Transcendentalist conception of Reason as a power of mind or soul that enables a person to grasp divine or Transcendent truth intuitively. (Ironically, Kant himself had explicitly denied the human mind such power. Such are the vagaries of intellectual history.) Coleridge's distinction reached most Transcendentalists through the American edition of his Aids to Reflection (1829), edited by Vermont Calvinist James Marsh (1794-1842). This indeed was \"the decisive event in establishing respect\" for Coleridge \"as a thinker,\" as the authoritative modern scholarly edition of Aids declares. Marsh's prefatory remarks chastised Locke and seconded the importance of the Reason-Understanding distinction in ways that prompted both foes and friends to lump Marsh with the Transcendentalists—to his acute irritation.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: Aids to Reflection, ed. James Marsh. Burlington, Vermont: Chauncey Goodrich, 1829. Reprinted from the original English edition of 1825.</p>\n<p>Reason is the Power of universal and necessary Convictions, the Source and Substance of Truths above Sense, and having their evidence in themselves. . . . Contemplated distinctively in reference to formal (or abstract) truth, it is the speculative Reason; but in reference to actual (or moral) truth, as the fountain of ideas and the Light of the Conscience, we name it the Practical Reason. Whenever by self-subjection to this universal Light, the Will of the Individual, the particular Will, has become a Will of Reason, the man is regenerate: and Reason is then the Spirit of the regenerated man, whereby the Person is capable of a quickening inter-communication with the Divine Spirit. . . .</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Judgments of the Understanding are binding only in relation to the objects of our Senses, which we reflect under the forms of the Understanding. . . .</p>\n<p>To apply these remarks for our present purpose, we have only to describe Understanding and Reason, each by its characteristic qualities. The comparison will show the difference.</p>\n<p>UNDERSTANDINGREASON</p>\n<p>1.Understanding is discursive.1.Reason is fixed.</p>\n<p>2.The Understanding in all its 2.The Reason in all its decisions</p>\n<p>judgments refers to some other appeals to itself as the ground</p>\n<p>faculty as its ultimate authority.and substance of their truth.</p>\n<p>3.Understanding is the faculty 3.Reason of Contemplation. . . .</p>\n<p>of Reflection.-Reason is a direct Aspect of Truth, an inward Beholding, having a similar relation to the Intelligible or Spiritual, as Sense has to the Material or Phenomenal.</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p>Transcendentalism was the first major intellectual movement in U.S. history, championing the inherent divinity of each individual, as well as the value of collective social action. In the mid-nineteenth century, the movement took off, changing how Americans thought about religion, literature, the natural world, class distinctions, the role of women, and the existence of slavery.<br>Edited by the eminent scholar Lawrence Buell, this comprehensive anthology contains the essential writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and their fellow visionaries. There are also reflections on the movement by Charles Dickens, Henry James, Walt Whitman, Louisa May Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. This remarkable volume introduces the radical innovations of a brilliant group of thinkers whose impact on religious thought, social reform, philosophy, and literature continues to reverberate in the twenty-first century.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<h1><font size=\"+3\">The Best American Short Stories 2004</font></h1>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n<h4><b>Houghton Mifflin Company</b></h4>\n<font size=\"-1\"><b>Copyright © 2004</b></font> <font size=\"-1\"><b>Houghton Mifflin<br>\n All right reserved.</b></font><br>\n <font size=\"-1\"><b>ISBN: 0-618-19734-6</b></font> <br>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n<br>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\nOver the years I have listened to fellow teachers and writers pronounce on literary fiction - its predators, prey, habits, and habitats - and as I've gotten older I have stopped taking notes and attempted instead not to fidget rudely in my seat. For some reason it seems that everything I hear now sounds increasingly untrue. Or at least no more true than its exact opposite. It seems that no matter what one says about reading and writing, or about short stories and novels, a hundred exceptions support the opposite case. Short stories are for busy people or short attention spans: Well, then why can a reader duck in and out of a novel for ten-minute intervals but not do so successfully with a short story? People don't read anymore: Then why are books being published - and sold - at a record number? There is no literary community: What are all these writing programs and reading series and book-groups-in-the-middle-of-nowhere? Perhaps all these assertions occur because, too often, and more and more, writers are asked to speak publicly of their art (oh, dear) or their approach to their craft (that alarmingly nautical phrase), and what has resulted may be simply the desperate, improvised creative-writing yack of good people uncomfortably far from their desks. \n<p>Nonetheless, opportunities such as thisintroduction encourage implausible pronouncements and sweeping generalizations, and though I am not easily encouraged, I am surely immune from nothing - a lesson learned from literature.</p>\n<p>There is no thoroughly convincing theory of the short story - it is technically a genre, not a form, but resists the definitions that usually cluster around both. There is the defining length (an unedifying fifty-page range), there is the short story's lonely voice from a submerged population (Frank O'Connor's famous hypothesis), and there are various \"slice of life\" ideas and notions of literary apprenticeship (stories are what writers do on their way to a novel).</p>\n<p>All of these convey what happens sometimes - what happens a lot - but in lieu of a truly winning overriding theory, we should rely perhaps on simple descriptions, in which case the more the merrier. Let me throw some into the pot. Many that I've heard - and used myself - are fashioned as metaphors comparing shorter and longer narratives, attempting to define the one through its relationship to the other. A short story is a love affair; a novel is a marriage.</p>\n<p>A short story is a photograph; a novel is a film. A short story is a weekend guest; a novel is a long-term boarder. A story is a brick; a novel is a brick wall. And my favorite, the asymmetrical a short story is a flower; a novel is a job.</p>\n<p>From its own tradition, the novel arrives to reader and writer alike, baggy, ad hoc, bitter with ambition, already half ruined. The short story arrives, modest, prim, and purposeful, aiming for perfection, though the lengthier it is, the more novel-like, the more it puts all that at risk, acquiring instead, in a compelling trade, the greater, sustained attention of the reader, upon whom a more lasting impression will be made, if all goes well. (This year's anthology, I think, tends to favor the longer short story.)</p>\n<p>Yet a story's very shortness ensures its largeness of accomplishment, its selfhood and purity. Having long lost its ability to pay an author's rent (in that golden blip between Henry James and television, F. Scott Fitzgerald, for one, wrote stories to fund his novels), the short story has been freed of its commercial life to become serious art, by its virtually every practitioner. As a result, short or long, a story lies less. It sings and informs and blurts. It has nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>In adding my own heedless descriptions to the stew, I have often liked to think that short stories have something in common with songs - not just the digested-in-a-single-sitting aspect of them, but their distillation of emotion and circumstance, their interest in beautiful pain. Like songs, there is often more urgency to them, less forewarning and professional calculation in their creation. Similarly, like songs, they are often about some kind of love gone bad - love for an overcoat, a tenor, a babysitter, to name three famous ones (by Gogol, Joyce, and Cheever) - or, at random from this book, love for a ranch, a waitress, a goat, a daughter (Proulx, Boyle, Munro, Lewis). These love objects represent lives and possibilities, spiritual entrances and exits, which are at one time within reach of a person but, as the story tells us, due to interesting, musical, and sorrowful particularities, soon pass by and away and without - like a long, empty train at a crossing.</p>\n<p>Oh, darlin'.</p>\n<p>For now, for my purposes here, this may have to do for a coarse, working hypothesis of the short story.</p>\n<p>If literature exists, as one wag has it, so that readers can spend time with people they would never want to in real life, then a short story might be considered doubly, deeply literary in that even its author - not just its reader - has decided to spend an abbreviated amount of time with its inhabitants (the characters a writer commits a lot of time to end up in novels).</p>\n<p>Perhaps this limitation accounts for the prevailing sadness of short stories. Authors of short stories are interested in the difficult emotions of their protagonists only up to a point. They are more interested in constructing a quick palimpsest of wounds and tones and triggering events. After that, the authors depart, exactly where the reader must depart: pre-noose. That is part of a story's melancholy and civility. Leave the bustling communities, cathartic weddings, and firing squads for novels.</p>\n<p>As for their oft stated affinity with poetry, short stories do have in common with poems an interest in how language completes one's understanding of the world, although the way language is used by ordinary people (registered within a story as the voices of its characters) can also disguise and obscure that understanding, a psychological and dramatic element a story usually takes more interest in than a poem. I would say that all the stories included herein are interested in how people talk. They are interested in the value, beauty, and malarkey of words that people utter to themselves or others. That is how human life is best captured on the page: through its sound. The stories here are interested, too, in the settings that shape this sound - landscapes are given vivid paint and life. Finally, stories generally, and certainly the ones here, are interested in some cultural truth delivered and given amnesty through the paradoxical project of narrative invention and the mechanisms of imagination. Unlike novels or poems, but more akin to a play, the short story is also an end-oriented form, and in the best ones the endings shine a light back upon the story illumining its meaning with both surprise and inevitability. If a story is not always, therapeutically, an axe for the frozen sea within us, then it is at least a pair of brutally sharpened ice skates.</p>\n<p>As for this year's story selection itself, correctly or not, I didn't view the process as a contest - why pit an apple against an orange - but as the assembling of a book, and the great variety of first-rate reading that is in it, I think, speaks to the health of the North American short story. (Eat your fruit!) Much has been made in this series about the editorial custom of \"reading blind\" - an honorable phrase suggestive of a fluency in Braille - and I did, late in the process, gruesomely burst a blood vessel in my eye, which made it difficult sometimes to see. But I must confess: I had read some of these stories before they came to me with their authors' names blackened out. I did so simply because I was not going to forego my usual habit of reading short stories as they appeared throughout the year in various magazines. This did not affect my opinions one way or the other, however, nor - I swear - did holding those babies up to the window light to see if I could make out any of those blacked-out names. Friends? Relatives? Could I pretend that brazen copyediting had caused me to fail to recognize one of my own stories and accidentally-on-purpose choose it? With all too many stories to pick from, in the end, as editorial criteria, I was left with only my own visceral responses to the stories themselves: Was I riveted? Did a story haunt me for days? Or did one nail drive out the other, as I ultimately read them in that most ungenerous but revealing of ways: from piles. Before reading all of them, as I received them in large packets in the mail (from Katrina Kenison, whose lovely name, in a spell of midwinter doldrums, I began to covet), I imagined my \"editorial criteria\" might be a simple matter of suicide prevention - which stories, for instance, did not send my own hands flying to my throat - though somewhat unexpectedly the reading became a joyous activity I felt disappointed to conclude (in the end, coveting Katrina Kenison's job, as well).</p>\n<p>The stories collected here impressed me with their depth of knowledge and feeling of character, setting, and situation - or at least with their convincingly fabricated semblance thereof. They spoke with amused intelligence, compassion, and dispassion, and I trusted their imaginative sources, which seemed not casual but from the deep center of a witnessing life and a thoughtful mind. True eloquence, said Daniel Webster, a little theatrically, cannot be brought from afar but must exist in the person, the subject, the occasion. \"If it comes at all it comes like the outbreaking of a fountain from the earth or the bursting of volcanic fires with spontaneous, original, native force, the clear conception outrunning the deductions of logic.\" Outrunning the deductions of logic is what literature does and why we read it. And a story - with its narrative version of a short man's complex - aims for quick eloquence and authority in voice and theme. But emotional heart and dramatic unpredictability are part of why it is the preferred form of fiction writers learning their art and why it has taken over much of our literary education - the Napoleon of the narrative world. A story's economy, its being one writer's intimate response to a world (as opposed to a novelist's long creation of a world), a response that must immerse a reader vividly and immediately, allows a gathering of twenty such responses in an anthology such as this and offers a kind of group portrait of how humanity is currently faring. Is that not, too, why we read short stories? To see in ways that television and newspapers cannot show us what others are up to - those who are ostensibly like us, as well as those ostensibly not? The stories here, I felt, did that.</p>\n<p>In the end, I noticed an assortment of perhaps not accidental things, such as the number of stories set in the distant past which failed to win me over entirely (is the short story sometimes too abbreviated a space to close that distance authentically and make the long ago seem real?). On the other hand, I noticed that a number of stories I'd chosen were written from the point of view of the opposite sex of the author (those by Fox, Smith, Proulx, Eisenberg, Waters). (Is the short story especially hospitable to this kind of transgendered sympathy and ventriloquism?)</p>\n<p>Mostly, however, I was intrigued by the very different stories I'd chosen that had certain random themes in common - or I assume random. One would be reluctant, even foolish, to offer these things up as indicative of something that in a widespread way is on the American mind. Nonetheless, two stories - Nell Freudenberger's \"The Tutor\" and Sarah Shun-lien Bynum's \"Accomplice\" - focus on a girl's academic ambitions and the awkward relationship those ambitions have to each girl's devoted father. \"'A toast,' said Julia's father,\" writes Freudenberger in a moment charged with love and irony. \"'To my daughter the genius.'\" And in Bynum's \"Accomplice\": There she saw her father, leaning forward very slightly, and holding onto the pew in front of him. He was smiling at her. Hugely. She lost her bearings entirely.\"</p>\n<p>Two urban romances - \"Grace\" by Paula Fox and \"Tooth and Claw,\" T. C. Boyle's loose update of \"The Lady or the Tiger?\" - use animals as MacGuffins, emblems, touchstones, and substitutes for human emotion, character, and appetite, as does Alice Munro's \"Runaway.\" Here is Munro's quite useful description of a goat: \"At first she had been Clark's pet entirely, following him everywhere, dancing for his attention. She was as quick and graceful and provocative as a kitten, and her resemblance to a guileless girl in love had made them both laugh. But as she grew older she seemed to attach herself to Carla, and in this attachment she was suddenly much wiser, less skittish - she seemed capable, instead, of a subdued and ironic sort of humor.\" And here is Boyle's wild African serval locked in a bedroom: \"The carpeting - every last strip of it - had been torn out of the floor, leaving an expanse of dirty plywood studded with nails, and there seemed to be a hole in the plasterboard just to the left of the window. A substantial hole. Even through the closed door I could smell the reek of cat piss or spray or whatever it was. 'There goes my deposit,' I said.\"</p>\n<p>Two stories - by the poet R. T. Smith and by Mary Yukari Waters - compassionately satirize the custodial culture that can spring up decades later in a war-vanquished land. Waters's \"Mirror Studies\" begins: \"The Kashigawa district, two hours from the Endos' home in Tokyo, was an isolated farming community with two claims to distinction: indigenous harrier monkeys up in the hills, and a new restaurant - Fireside Rations - that served 'rice' made from locally grown yams. This restaurant had been featured in an Asahi Shimbun article about the trendy resurgence of wartime food, also known as nostalgia cuisine ... City dwellers, jaded by French and Madeiran cuisine, were flocking out on weekends to try it.\" In Smith's dramatic monologue, \"Docent,\" a romantically jilted tour guide, done up with Confederate absurdity in a hoop skirt and hairnet, warns, \"If you have a morbid curiosity about the Fall of the South - which is not the same as a healthy historical interest - please save your comments for your own diaries and private conversations.\"</p>\n<p>Edward Jones's \"A Rich Man\" and Thomas McGuane's \"Gallatin Canyon\" pull no punches in their sharply written tales of masculine vanity's bravado and backfirings. In \"A Rich Man,\" Horace, set up for a fall, sees himself as \"the cock of the walk.\" When, in \"Gallatin Canyon,\" the protagonist, proud of his recent material success, asks his girlfriend what she thinks of the new prosperity around them, she says, presciently, \"I'm not sure it's such a good thing, living in a boomtown. It's basically a high-end carny atmosphere.\" Which is what, in a way, ensues in both stories.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n <font size='-2'>Excerpted from <b>The Best American Short Stories 2004</b> Copyright © 2004 by Houghton Mifflin .

Moore calls the collection \"a kind of group portrait of how humanity is currently faring,\" and one gets the impression that it's faring poorly in rather consistent ways, if the number of characters here who are down-in-the-dumps guys drinking too much is any indication. Sherman Alexie's homeless Spokane Indian in \"What You Pawn I Will Redeem\" is an alcoholic with a \"busted stomach.\" T. Coraghessan Boyle's southern California transplant in \"Tooth and Claw\" is most comfortable in a bar filled with old men drinking themselves into oblivion, like his father. And Stuart Dybek's Chicago hit man in \"Breasts\" wakes up with a hangover on the Sunday he's supposed to \"do a job.\" Then there's John, in Paula Fox's \"Grace,\" a lonely accountant whose dog, Grace, gives him some way of connecting with others until she develops heartworm, resulting in his slugging down four whiskeys and deciding to order a steak. Charles D'Ambrosio's \"Screenwriter,\" who gets a day pass from the psych ward, visits a former patient he calls the ballerina, gets drunk, takes some of her meds, and watches her burn her nipples with cigarettes and pour hot wax on her thigh. John Updike's David Kern, who uses his 50th high-school reunion to remember his first real kiss, is a quiet relief from all this, as are Alice Munro's masterful \"Runaway\" and the fetching homage to Munro, Trudy Lewis's \"Limestone Diner.\" Mary Yukari Waters and John Edgar Wideman also bring welcome spaciousness, with stories about, respectively, a Japanese primate specialist adjusting to a heart conditionand memories of the war years, and a man whose search for the imprisoned son of a deceased friend opens him back to life. A familiar and ultimately disappointing selection. Short-story aficionados know by now to turn to the Pushcart anthologies for new voices.\n\n</article>"

Rosenblum, who edits the City section, has collected 40 representative pieces that showcase the ups and downs of life in a metropolis that still exerts a gravitational pull on those seeking their fortune. Many of the essays are by well-known authors, such as Jan Morris, Phillip Lopate and Vivian Gornick, but others, equally winning, are by emerging writers. All of the pieces are engrossing and share a painstaking attention to craft. Mel Gussow dramatically evokes the day in 1970 when the Greenwich Village townhouse next door to him, occupied by members of the radical Weather Underground, was blown apart in an accidental detonation in their basement bomb factory. On a lighter note, Tara Bahrampour recounts the paradigmatic New York experience: searching for an affordable apartment.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>The City section of the Sunday edition of the New York Times features vivid accounts of life, past and present, in the five boroughs. Rosenblum, who edits the City section, has collected 40 representative pieces that showcase the ups and downs of life in a metropolis that still exerts a gravitational pull on those seeking their fortune. Many of the essays are by well-known authors, such as Jan Morris, Phillip Lopate and Vivian Gornick, but others, equally winning, are by emerging writers. All of the pieces are engrossing and share a painstaking attention to craft. Mel Gussow dramatically evokes the day in 1970 when the Greenwich Village townhouse next door to him, occupied by members of the radical Weather Underground, was blown apart in an accidental detonation in their basement bomb factory. On a lighter note, Tara Bahrampour recounts the paradigmatic New York experience: searching for an affordable apartment. Field Maloney and Jill Eisenstadt each relate the glory days of Queens's Rockaway Beach as a summer resort, its sad decline and enduring allure.

Because it is distributed only in papers in New York City, most of the essays in this collection will be new to readers outside the area. Organized in broad categories such as \"New Yorkers,\" \"A Sense of Place,\" \"Moods and Mores,\" and \"City Lore,\" the topics of this compilation range from the humorous, such as the reluctance of New Yorkers to acknowledge the bizarre behavior happening around them, to the poignant, as in the essay about the vulnerability one writer feels after being burglarized. Given the subject matter, it should come as no surprise that the pieces evoke a powerful sense of place. Coming as this does from the pages of the New York Times, it is also no surprise that the material is of high literary caliber. Recommended for medium to large public libraries; academic libraries with journalism or New York City collections may also wish to consider.-Rita Simmons, Sterling Heights P.L., MI Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From the Publisher</h4><p>“A reminder that there are stories still untold in New York, and writers hard at work to find them for us.”<br>\n-<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p>\n<p>,</p>\n<p>“You don't have to have a particular interest in the Big Apple to pick up this book.

    "overview": "<p>As the descendants of Mexican immigrants have settled throughout the United States, a great literature has emerged, but its correspondances with the literature of Mexico have gone largely unobserved. In <i>Bordering Fires</i>, the first anthology to combine writing from both sides of the Mexican-U.S. border, Cristina Garc’a presents a richly diverse cross-cultural conversation. Beginning with Mexican masters such as Alfonso Reyes and Juan Rulfo, Garc’a highlights historic voices such as “the godfather of Chicano literature” Rudolfo Anaya, and Gloria Anzaldœa, who made a powerful case for language that reflects bicultural experience. From the fierce evocations of Chicano reality in Jimmy Santiago Baca’s Poem IX to the breathtaking images of identity in Coral Bracho’s poem “Fish of Fleeting Skin,” from the work of Carlos Fuentes to Sandra Cisneros, Ana Castillo to Octavio Paz, this landmark collection of fiction, essays, and poetry offers an exhilarating new vantage point on our continent–and on the best of contemporary literature.</p>",
    "excerpt": "<p>ALFONSO REYES</p>\n<p>Major Aranda’s Hand</p>\n<p>Major Aranda suffered the loss of a hand in battle, and, unfortunately for him, it was his right hand. Other people make collections of hands of bronze, of ivory, of glass and of wood; at times they come from religious statues or images; at times they are antique door knockers. And surgeons keep worse things in jars of alcohol. Why not preserve this severed hand, testimony to a glorious deed? Are we sure that the hand is of less value than the brain or the heart?</p>\n<p>Let us meditate about it. Aranda did not meditate, but was impelled by a secret instinct. Theological man has been shaped in clay, like a doll, by the hand of God. Biological man evolves thanks to the service of his hand, and his hand has endowed the world with a new natural kingdom, the kingdom of the industries and the arts. If the strong walls of Thebes rose to the music of Amphion’s lyre, it was his brother Zethus, the mason, who raised the stones with his hand. Manual laborers appear therefore in archaic mythologies, enveloped in magic vapor: they are the wonder-workers. They are “The Hands Delivering the Fire” that Orozco has painted. In Diego Rivera’s mural the hand grasps the cosmic globe that contains the powers of creation and destruction; and in Chapingo the proletarian hands are ready to reclaim the patrimony of the earth.</p>\n<p>The other senses remain passive, but the manual sense experiments and adds and, from the spoils of the earth, constructs a human order, the son of man. It models both the jar and the planet; it moves the potter’s wheel and opens the Suez Canal.</p>\n<p>A delicate and powerful instrument, it possesses the most fortunate physical resources: hinges, pincers, tongs, hooks, bony little chains, nerves, ligaments, canals, cushions, valleys and hillocks. It is soft and hard, aggressive and loving.</p>\n<p>A marvelous flower with five petals that open and close like the sensitive plant, at the slightest provocation! Is five an essential number in the universal harmonies? Does the hand belong to the order of the dog rose, the forget-me-not, the scarlet pimpernel? Palmists perhaps are right in substance although not in their interpretations. And if the physiognomists of long ago had gone on from the face to the hand, completing their vague observations, undoubtedly they would have figured out correctly that the face mirrors and expresses but that the hand acts.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt about it, the hand deserves unusual respect, and it could indeed occupy the favorite position among the household gods of Major Aranda.</p>\n<p>The hand was carefully deposited in a quilted jewel case. The folds of white satin seemed a diminutive Alpine landscape. From time to time intimate friends were granted the privilege of looking at it for a few minutes. It was a pleasing, robust, intelligent hand, still in a rather tense position from grasping the hilt of the sword. It was perfectly preserved.</p>\n<p>Gradually this mysterious object, this hidden talisman, became familiar. And then it emigrated from the treasure chest to the showcase in the living room, and a place was made for it among the campaign and high military decorations.</p>\n<p>Its nails began to grow, revealing a slow, silent, surreptitious life. At one moment this growth seemed something brought on by inertia, at another it was evident that it was a natural vir- tue. With some repugnance at first, the manicurist of the family consented to take care of those nails each week. The hand was always polished and well cared for.</p>\n<p>Without the family knowing how it happened—that’s how man is, he converts the statue of the god into a small art object—the hand descended in rank; it suffered a manus diminutio; it ceased to be a relic and entered into domestic circulation. After six months it acted as a paperweight or served to hold the leaves of the manuscripts—the major was writing his memoirs now with his left hand; for the severed hand was flexible and plastic and the docile fingers maintained the position imposed upon them.</p>\n<p>In spite of its repulsive coldness, the children of the house ended up by losing respect for it. At the end of a year, they were already scratching themselves with it or amused themselves by folding its fingers in the form of various obscene gestures of international folklore.</p>\n<p>The hand thus recalled many things that it had completely forgotten. Its personality was becoming noticeable. It acquired its own consciousness and character. It began to put out feelers. Then it moved like a tarantula. Everything seemed an occasion for play. And one day, when it was evident that it had put on a glove all by itself and had adjusted a bracelet on the severed wrist, it did not attract the attention of anyone.</p>\n<p>It went freely from one place to another, a monstrous little lap dog, rather crablike. Later it learned to run, with a hop very similar to that of hares, and, sitting back on the fingers, it began to jump in a prodigious manner. One day it was seen spread out on a current of air: it had acquired the ability to fly.</p>\n<p>But in doing all these things, how did it orient itself, how did it see? Ah! Certain sages say that there is a faint light, imperceptible to the retina, perhaps perceptible to other organs, particularly if they are trained by education and exercise. Should not the hand see also? Of course it complements its vision with its sense of touch; it almost has eyes in its fingers, and the palm is able to find its bearings through the gust of air like the membranes of a bat. Nanook, the Eskimo, on his cloudy polar steppes, raises and waves the weather vanes to orient himself in an apparently uniform environment. The hand captures a thousand fleeting things and penetrates the translucent currents that escape the eye and the muscles, those currents that are not visible and that barely offer any resistance.</p>\n<p>The fact is that the hand, as soon as it got around by itself, became ungovernable, became temperamental. We can say that it was then that it really “got out of hand.” It came and went as it pleased. It disappeared when it felt like it; returned when it took a fancy to do so. It constructed castles of improbable balance out of bottles and wineglasses. It is said that it even became intoxicated; in any case, it stayed up all night.</p>\n<p>It did not obey anyone. It was prankish and mischievous. It pinched the noses of callers, it slapped collectors at the door. It remained motionless, playing dead, allowing itself to be contemplated by those who were not acquainted with it, and then suddenly it would make an obscene gesture. It took singular pleasure in chucking its former owner under the chin, and it got into the habit of scaring the flies away from him. He would regard it with tenderness, his eyes brimming with tears, as he would regard a son who had proved to be a black sheep.</p>\n<p>It upset everything. Sometimes it took a notion to sweep and tidy the house; other times it would mix up the shoes of the family with a true arithmetical genius for permutations, combinations and changes; it would break the window panes by throwing rocks, or it would hide the balls of the boys who were playing in the street.</p>\n<p>The major observed it and suffered in silence. His wife hated it, and of course was its preferred victim. The hand, while it was going on to other exercises, humiliated her by giving her lessons in needlework or cooking.</p>\n<p>The truth is that the family became demoralized. The one-handed man was depressed and melancholy, in great contrast to his former happiness. His wife became distrustful and easily frightened, almost paranoid. The children became negligent, abandoned their studies, and forgot their good manners. Everything was sudden frights, useless drudgery, voices, doors slamming, as if an evil spirit had entered the house. The meals were served late, sometimes in the parlor, sometimes in a bedroom because, to the consternation of the major, to the frantic protest of his wife, and to the furtive delight of the children, the hand had taken possession of the dining room for its gymnastic exercises, locking itself inside, and receiving those who tried to expel it by throwing plates at their heads. One just had to yield, to surrender with weapons and baggage, as Aranda said.</p>\n<p>The old servants, even the nurse who had reared the lady of the house, were put to flight. The new servants could not endure the bewitched house for a single day. Friends and relatives deserted the family. The police began to be disturbed by the constant complaints of the neighbors. The last silver grate that remained in the National Palace disappeared as if by magic. An epidemic of robberies took place, for which the mysterious hand was blamed, though it was often innocent.</p>\n<p>The most cruel aspect of the case was that people did not blame the hand, did not believe that there was such a hand animated by its own life, but attributed everything to the wicked devices of the poor one-handed man, whose severed member was now threatening to cost us what Santa Anna’s leg cost us. Undoubtedly Aranda was a wizard who had made a pact with Satan. People made the sign of the cross.</p>\n<p>In the meantime the hand, indifferent to the harm done to others, acquired an athletic musculature, became robust, steadily got into better shape, and learned how to do more and more things. Did it not try to continue the major’s memoirs for him? The night when it decided to get some fresh air in the auto- mobile, the Aranda family, incapable of restraining it, believed that the world was collapsing; but there was not a single accident, nor fines nor bribes to pay the police. The major said that at least the car, which had been getting rusty after the flight of the chauffeur, would be kept in good condition that way.</p>\n<p>Left to its own nature, the hand gradually came to embody the Platonic idea that gave it being, the idea of seizing, the eagerness to acquire control. When it was seen how hens perished with their necks twisted or how art objects belonging to other people arrived at the house—which Aranda went to all kinds of trouble to return to their owners, with stammerings and incomprehensible excuses—it was evident that the hand was an animal of prey and a thief.</p>\n<p>People now began to doubt Aranda’s sanity. They spoke of hallucinations, of “raps” or noises of spirits, and of other things of a like nature. The twenty or thirty persons who really had seen the hand did not appear trustworthy when they were of the servant class, easily swayed by superstitions; and when they were people of moderate culture, they remained silent and answered with evasive remarks for fear of compromising themselves or being subject to ridicule. A round table of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature devoted itself to discussing a certain anthropological thesis concerning the origin of myths.</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p><P>As the descendants of Mexican immigrants have settled throughout the United States, a great literature has emerged, but its correspondances with the literature of Mexico have gone largely unobserved. In <i>Bordering Fires</i>, the first anthology to combine writing from both sides of the Mexican-U.S. border, Cristina Garc&#8217;a presents a richly diverse cross-cultural conversation. Beginning with Mexican masters such as Alfonso Reyes and Juan Rulfo, Garc&#8217;a highlights historic voices such as &#8220;the godfather of Chicano literature&#8221; Rudolfo Anaya, and Gloria Anzald&#339;a, who made a powerful case for language that reflects bicultural experience. From the fierce evocations of Chicano reality in Jimmy Santiago Baca&#8217;s Poem IX to the breathtaking images of identity in Coral Bracho&#8217;s poem &#8220;Fish of Fleeting Skin,&#8221; from the work of Carlos Fuentes to Sandra Cisneros, Ana Castillo to Octavio Paz, this landmark collection of fiction, essays, and poetry offers an exhilarating new vantage point on our continent&#8211;and on the best of contemporary literature.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The timeliness of this work cannot be questioned, since it features essays, fiction, and poetry that reflect the formidable physical and psychological boundary between the United States and Mexico. Editor Garc a (Dreaming in Cuban) contends that the border has shaped artistic expression on both sides; these selections suggest the frustration Latinos face as they ambulate between two cultures. Gloria Anzald a's \"How To Tame a Wild Tongue\" describes the bilingual acrobatics executed by many Latinos, Rub n Mart nez's \"Crossing Over\" narrates the travails of the border, and Richard Rodriguez's \"India\" offers an unflinching view on the issue of miscegenation. Of equal importance, however, is the Mexican literature that preceded contemporary Latino writing. For this reason, Garc a includes selections from distinguished Mexican writers (e.g., Rulfo, Paz, Poniatowska, Monsiv is, Fuentes, and many others) whose work has both reflected and influenced the Mexican psyche. In this sense, the book serves as an important sampling of Mexico's best authors. Although similar to the recent Mexico: A Traveler's Literary Companion, which helps the traveler understand Mexico, this new work helps Mexico and the United States understand the traveler from and between these two worlds.

Authors include earlier masters (Alfonso Reyes, Juan Rulfo), contemporary greats (Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes), Chicana/o voices (Sandra Cisneros, Rudolfo Anaya, Ruben Martínez), and new Mexican authors who are becoming internationally known (Carlos Monsiváis, Coral Bracho). Not surprisingly, many of the selections deal with questions of identity and allegiance.

Lloyd Ultan and Barbara Unger place this literature in its historical context and reproduce here one hundred vintage photographs and postcard views that bring the writings to life. The resulting book provides the reader with insights into the kaleidoscopic shifts in Bronx life over the centuries. Filtered through the imaginations of authors of different times, ethnic groups, social classes, and literary styles, the borough of The Bronx emerges not only as a shaper of destinies and lives, but as an important literary mecca. <p>\"I am living out of town about 13 miles/ at a village called Fordham, on the railroad leading north. We are in a snug little cottage, keeping house, and would be very comfortable, but that I have been for a long time dreadfully ill. ... I am done with drink-depend upon that. . . .

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Booknews</h4>Official Bronx Borough Historian Ultan (history, Fairleigh Dickinson U.) and poet Unger (English, Rockland Community College) assemble excerpts from known and unknown writers, and black-and-white photographs, to chronicle the history of New York City's northernmost borough from the middle of the 17th century to the present. The material is presented according to the period the writer is discussing rather than by publication date. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>New York Times Book Review</h4>Gouverneur Morris fights the new American government in vain to prevent a road from cutting through his large farm. Edgar Allan Poe takes refuge in the village of Fordham, which is so isolated it has no post office. . . . Clive Campbell and Joseph Saddler are reborn as the hip-hop artists Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash. Through such moments Lloyd Ultan and Barbara Unger tell the history of the borough in <i>Bronx Accent: A Literary and Pictorial History of the Borough</i>. . . . The result is a vibrant mix of historical and contemporary voices; at one point an excerpt from E. L. Doctorow's novel Billy Bathgate is followed by an account from Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>New York Observer</h4>Anyone interested in urban history, in American literature or, more generally, in how people shapeùand, in turn, are shaped byùplace, will find <i>Bronx Accent</i> a fascinating book. Like some ingenious choral arrangement, the book contains scores of voices recounting, in fact and fiction, how life was lived in the Bronx from colonial times to the end of the 20th century. The authors . . . provide a well-constructed narrative that frames the story of New York City's northernmost borough. But like good straight men in a comedy act, they do an excellent job of setting things up and then stepping out of the way, leaving all the high notes to poets, novelists, letter-writers, diarists, urban scholars and journalists. Part comedy, part tragedy, part cautionary tale, the book conjures up the early years of the Bronx as a woodsy retreat from the rigors of life in the great city to the south; the Bronx heyday, which lasted from about the beginning of the last century to its mid-point; and the borough's chaotic decline and recent rise from the ashes.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>New York Post</h4>The authors take a novel approach: By placing examples of classic writing (Poe, Twain, Baldwin, Kerouac, Wolfe and Wouk, among others) and vintage photographs of da boogie down in historical context, <i>Bronx Accent</i> gives the reader unique insights into the ækaleidoscopic shifts in life in the Bronx over the centuries.'.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Forward</h4>[Bronx Accent] celebrates its subject. The editorsùa historian who knows more about the borough than anyone living and a poet born and reared in it streetsùembrace the stubborn triumph of a Bronx now on the verge of a renaissance. . . . It is as if each writer included in the book is a friend or family, a literary Bronx meshpochah.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booklist</h4>Ultan and Unger chronicle the rise, fall, and rebirth of New York City's northernmost borough in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry by people who live or lived in the Bronx, or who simply chose to write about it. . . . Taken together the pieces, with additional explanatory text by the authors give a good narrative ranging from the Bronx's colonial period through the various waves of immigration and consolidation with Manhattan and the other boroughs. What's more, you get a good sense of how the many destructive forces converged to wreck the area, and how the people's stubborn spirit would not let all of their beloved neighborhoods turn to wasteland. . . . As the subtitle declares, it's also a pictorial history, and the majority of the 97 black-and-white illustrations give you a good idea of what the Bronx looked like way back in its heyday.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Bronx Press</h4>Bronx Accent is particularly strong in explaining the twentieth century, when the population of The Bronx was at its highest and most of the writers cited resided in the borough. The book is adroitly arranged and provides hours of good and interesting reading. For $32.00, this publication of Rutgers University Press is a bargain. No where else can anyone find a survey of the Bronx past in one volume that can be so easily and enjoyably digested.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Bronx Press-Review and the Riverdale Review</h4>The embattled Bronx and upscale Riverdale have been portrayed, analyzed and sometimes autopsied by journalists, sociologists and historians. But nobody has ever listened to its beating heart through its literatureùthe novels, stories, poetry and memoirs that capture the essence and excitement of Bronx life. Nobody has done it, that is, until now. . . . As an added bonus, the book features nearly 100 vintage photographs and postcard views, the postcards, some almost a century old. . . . Bronx Accent should have a far wider readership than just in the Bronx, since the Bronx, and writing like this, reflect so much of urban America, and its story in many ways is the story of America itself.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Bronx County Historical Journal</h4>The book is full of insights and very readable. It does justice to the colonies and rural Bronx of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, it is especially rich in describing the twentieth-century urban scene, where there are so many different communities. . . . Ultan and Unger's work is both good history and good literature. Based on extensive research with scholarly selection of representative sources, it gives voice to the enduring spirit of The Bronx. If you would understand this place, start here.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Jewish Journal</h4>Ultan and Unger emphasize and literary history of the Bronx, providing ample quotations to illustrate literature about the Bronx. They also have almost a hundred interesting photos. The material is organized chronologically, beginning with Jonas Bronck who, in the early 17th century, became the first European settler of the area that today bears is name.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Roger Wines</h4>Through three hundred years, the people of the Bronx speak out about their lives, joys, tribulations, and aspirations. Lloyd Ultan and Barbara Unger's skillfully arranged anthology combines letters, diaries, memoirs, and literary sources with an insightful historical narrative. The book is particularly rich on the recent decades when the Bronx went from success to collapse and then rebirth. It is good reading and good history.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Editor of Editors on Editing&amp;#58; What Writers Nee Gerald Gross</h4>Bronx Accent is an entertaining, surprising revelation of New York's borough of the Bronx, an unexpected center of literature where some of America's most famous authors lived, and which provided the setting and inspiration for their works. Their novels, poems, stories, and essays reveal the colorful, ever-changing history of this often underappreciated part of the city. Ultan and Unger are insightful chroniclers of the vast variety of their urban experiences. You will be delighted and astonished by the riches to be found in this literary treasure house.\n\n</article>"

A journalist (Live from Death Row, LJ 5/1/95) and self-described \"professional revolutionary\" accused of killing a Philadelphia police officer, Abu-Jamal has won international attention for his case. Prison walls, however, have done little to deter his activism. His latest book has a markedly spiritual undertone, as he discusses his views on religion and fellow inmates' thoughts on the subject. In this compilation of over 35 short commentaries and poems, the author questions the validity of Christianity and traces his struggles with religion. In one touching essay, he compares children to acorns, saying that they possess the power to grow into mighty oak trees. Abu-Jamal's words flow like the very sap of those trees, pulsing with energy and capturing the essence of life. Recommended for both public and academic libraries.Erin Cassin, \"Library Journal\"</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p>FOREWORD</p>\n<p>I am so grateful for this book celebrating the Children’s Defense Fund’s thirtieth anniversary. This gift of thirty-four extraordinary American writers sharing their stories of growing up in America paints a complex, richly detailed, and achingly real portrait of American childhood. Every reader will catch glimpses of his or her own childhood and see the childhoods of others with new eyes.<br>\n Tina McElroy Ansa remembers her nurturing black Georgia family and community as a world “made up of stories,” and listening at her mother’s side “as she whipped up batter for one of her light-as-air, sweet-as-mother’s- love desserts.” In a town on Chicago’s North Shore, Mary Morris learns early on how girls and women can get into “trouble,” while boys and men escape blame—and, since she is a girl, she makes an exit plan, just in case. Michael Patrick MacDonald sees his father’s face for the first time at his funeral and leaves the service with a renewed appreciation for the family he does have and the unspoken community of love and loyalty that surrounds him in his poor and desperate “white trash” South Boston neighborhood: “For once in my life I felt I should be proud of where I came from, who I was, and who I might become, and for a moment was ashamed for having ever felt otherwise.” Lois-Ann Yamanaka writes about trying not to panic when the autistic son she loves so fiercely sees balloons in the supermarket checkout line, knowing the moment is about to escalate into a .t of frustrated screaming and thrashing that will force her to drag him from the store while other customers stare in disgust: “In JohnJohn’s world, I can afford to buy him every balloon on every trip to the market. In JohnJohn’s world, he takes all of the shiny balloons home to our yard full of white ginger blossoms and lets all of them go . . . [a] moment of beauty, his silent freedom.” Anna Quindlen looks at the overscheduled lives of today’s children and mourns what’s been lost: “Pickup games. Hanging out. How boring it was. Of course, it was the making of me, as a human being and a writer. Downtime is where we become ourselves, looking into the middle distance, kicking at the curb, lying on the grass or sitting on the stoop and staring at the tedious blue of the summer sky. I don’t believe you can write poetry or compose music or become an actor without downtime, and plenty of it, a hiatus that passes for boredom but is really the quiet moving of the wheels inside that fuel creativity.” Alan Cheuse writes about his especially fortunate circumstances growing up on the water: “I don’t know how it would have been, born into a town without a coastline . . . The ebb and flow of waters, the detritus, flotsam, treasures left behind on the sand, the marine life, fresh water and salt mingling in the tides, the sound of buoys on summer nights, bells, horns, the ships anchored within sight of our playlands: the hope this gives you as a child, there is almost no explaining.” And in another world, Julia Alvarez dreams of someday being able to turn her life story into a book another little girl might want to read—“a girl like me, no longer frightened by / the whisperings of terrified adults, / the cries of uncles being rounded up, / the sirens of the death squads racing by.” As singular as every one of these stories of childhood is, common threads run through them, linking experiences across race, class, and geography. The role of many memorable adults who stand up for children is striking. I hope readers will recognize people like them in their own lives: Alexs Pate’s mother, determined that her son will not be mistreated by teachers or led to believe he x FOREWORD is destined to be a “negative statistic,” on yet another determined march to the principal’s office in his defense; Anthony Grooms’s mother putting him and his sister to bed at Christmas to the sounds of Burl Ives and Nat King Cole; Robert Bausch’s father pretending to wake his six children up on Christmas morning by blaring Benny Goodman or Glenn Miller on the hi-.; Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston’s and Bich Minh Nguyen’s grandmothers, suspicious of the neighbors, the children’s friends, the toadstools in the front yard—any of the pieces of the outside world that might somehow bring their family harm. And John Edgar Wideman’s mother, sitting at her apartment window watching for the child out way too late, prepared to wait up as long as it takes to dream him home safely.<br>\n Reading these stories, we may wonder what our children will remember about us. Will we be remembered for doing everything we could to dream them home safely? Even ideal childhoods are marked with some degree of fear and uncertainty. Scary movies, bullies, illness, and death are timeless. But while generations throughout history have often looked back to the times before them as simpler and mooooore innocent, in many ways childhood today may be more dangerous than ever. Pervasive cultural, domestic, and community violence, child abuse and neglect, drugs, high rates of hunger and homelessness, and tenuous family and community supports ravage the lives and dreams of countless young people. Community breakdown has coincided with a culture saturated with violence- and sex-filled images, and too many parents seek to meet children’s needs with things rather than time. Too many children are left alone to sort out the values promoted relentlessly by television, movies, and video games. Safety nets for children and families are being eroded as politicians place millionaires’ desires before children’s needs. And year by year it seems as if adults’ hold on our children’s hands and values is becoming looser and looser, so that too many children sink in the quicksand of materialism and spiritual poverty.<br>\n There are sad stories and painful memories in this collection, but also a great deal of hope, as seen in children’s resilience, their small kindnesses to other children, the writers’ ability to look back through the lens of time at the parents and siblings and houses and neighborhoods they were given and understand what true gifts these things were. And with all their accumulated flaws, the adults in these essays sometimes appear at their best, too, in stories of parents who hold on to their children through minor crises and major catastrophes, refusing to let go. May each reader learn to do the same for every one of our children, until collectively and individually we are able to dream them all home safely.<br>\n—Marian Wright Edelman</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2003 by the Children’s Defense Fund.

Dissimilar experiences can each sound uniquely American, such as the stability of Patricia Elam's refreshingly functional family, in which \"the only thing that distinguished us from the families on Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It to Beaver, and Father Knows Best... was our brown skin\"; the quiet confusion of Michael Patrick MacDonald, who \"decided that `normal' certainly meant something somewhere out there, beyond... where we lived\"; or the poignant isolation of Nina Revoyr as the only Japanese child in Marshfield, Wis. This collection successfully gathers many voices, completing an impassioned picture of growing up in America. Thirty-four authors, including Chang-rae Lee, Alice Walker and John Edgar Wideman, lyrically portray their younger years. Each piece-whether describing the bluffs of Illinois, the movie houses of Paris, Tex., or Christmas in Alabama-illustrate how childhood informs adulthood. As Lisa Page writes, as we age, \"the child remains, transcended, often denied, but there all the same, hiding beneath our business suits, our corporate uniforms, the camouflage we wear to communicate our grown-up selves.\" While most essays are magical, a few are forced and the flow of the anthology suffers from its alphabetical, rather than thematic, organization. But these are easily overlooked flaws in this beautiful compilation that proves that \"childhood, of course, never ends.\" (Oct. 22) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

The authors come from a wide range of backgrounds and from different parts of America, yet there is a commonality to all of their stories as well as a sense of how distinct each of our childhood experiences are. Some of the authors are well known, such as the editor, Susan Richards Shreve, Anna Quindlen, and Alice Walker, but some of the most poignant writing comes from young authors, like Bich Minh Nguyen, especially those who came to America from a different culture and made the adjustment. Most stories reveal how important it is to be like everyone else as a child, but many are about the moment when the child discovers the importance of being unique. \"Foreigner in Marshfield\" is an example of how being different often teaches a child important lessons about being yourself. This collection is excellent for many reasons and it attempts to give all races and ethnic backgrounds equal time. KLIATT Codes: JSA*—Exceptional book, recommended for junior and senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2003, Houghton Mifflin, Mariner, 223p., Ages 12 to adult. <br>\n—Nola Theiss\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) is dedicated to the mission of \"leaving no child behind,\" especially those who are poor, disabled, or minority. This collection of 34 essays, assembled in celebration of the organization's 30th birthday, provides a balanced blend of essays on childhood contributed by such authors as Joyce Carol Oates, Anna Quindlen, and Alice Walker. All of the essays are highly readable and of high quality, even when the contributor is not as well known. And since each piece represents a unique experience, the essays may be read in random order. From the sweetness of Tina McElroy Ansa's \"The Center of the Universe\" to the poignancy of Alexis Pate's \"Innocence Found,\" the collection teems with memorable narratives. Especially moving are the stories told in the first person, with a hint of nostalgia for childhood. Many feature children living in poverty or with less than ideal parents, but the tone never sinks to cynicism. A foreword by CDF founder and president Edelman rounds out the text. With such a low price and proceeds going to an excellent cause, this work is recommended for all collections.-Jan Brue Enright, Augustana Coll.

    "excerpt": "<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>Entertainment has a bad name. Serious people, some of whom write short stories, learn to mistrust and even to revile it. The word wears spandex, pasties, a leisure suit studded with blinking lights. It gives off a whiff of Coppertone and dripping Creamsicle, the fake-butter miasma of a movie- house lobby, of karaoke and Jagermeister, Jerry Bruckheimer movies, a Street Fighter machine grunting solipsistically in the corner of an ice-rink arcade, bread and circuses, the Weekly World News. Entertainment trades in cliché and product placement. It sells action figures and denture adhesive. It engages regions of the brain far from the centers of discernment, critical thinking, ontological speculation. It skirts the black heart of life and drowns life’s lambency in a halogen glare. Intelligent people must keep a certain distance from its productions. They must handle the things that entertain them with gloves of irony and postmodern tongs. Entertainment, in short, means junk, and too much junk is bad for you—bad for your heart, your arteries, your mind, your soul.<br>\n But maybe these intelligent and serious people, my faithful straw men, are wrong. Maybe the reason for the junkiness of so much of what pretends to entertain us is that we have accepted—indeed, we have helped to articulate—such a narrow, debased concept of entertainment. The brain is an organ of entertainment, sensitive at any depth and over a wide spectrum. But we have learned to mistrust and despise our human aptitude for being entertained, and in that sense we get the entertainment we deserve.<br>\n I’d like to believe that, because I read for entertainment, and I write to entertain. Period. Oh, I could decoct a brew of other, more impressive motivations and explanations. I could uncork some stuff about reader response theory, or the Lacanian parole. I could go on—God knows I’ve done it elsewhere—about the storytelling impulse and the need to make sense of experience through story. A spritz of Jung might scent the air. I could adduce Kafka’s formula, as the brilliant Lorrie Moore did in this space last year, of a book as an axe for the frozen sea within. I could go down to the café at the local mega-bookstore and take some wise words of Abelard or Koestler, about the power of literature, off a mug. But in the end—here’s my point—it would still all boil down to entertainment, and its suave henchman, pleasure. Because when the axe bites the ice, you feel an answering throb of delight all the way from your hands to your shoulders, and the blade tolls like a bell for miles.<br>\n Therefore I would like to propose expanding our definition of entertainment to encompass everything pleasurable that arises from the encounter of an attentive mind with a page of literature. In so doing I will only be codifying what has, all my life, been my operating definition.<br>\n Here is a sample, chosen at random from my career as a reader, of encounters that would be covered under my new definition of entertainment: the engagement of the interior ear by the rhythm and pitch of an original prose style; the dawning awareness that giant mutant rat people dwell in the walls of a ruined abbey in England; two hours spent bushwhacking through a densely packed argument about the structures of power as embodied in nineteenth-century prison architecture; the consummation of a great love aboard a lost Amazonian riverboat or in Elizabethan slang; the intricate fractal patterning of motif and metaphor in Nabokov and Neil Gaiman; stories of pirates, zeppelins, sinister children; a thousand-word-long sentence comparing homosexuals to the Jews in a page of Proust; a duel to the death with broadswords on the seacoast of ancient Zingara; the outrageousness of whale slaughter or mule slaughter in Melville or Cormac McCarthy; the outrageousness of Dr. Charles Bovary’s clubfoot- correcting device; the outrageousness of outrage in a page of Philip Roth; words written in smoke across the London sky on a day in June 1923; a momentary gain in my own sense of shared despair, shared nullity, shared rapture, shared loneliness, shared brokenhearted glee; the recounting of a portentous birth, a disastrous wedding, or a midnight deathwatch on the Neva.<br>\n The original sense of the word entertainment is a lovely one of mutual support through intertwining, like a pair of trees grown together, each sustaining and bearing up the other. It suggests a kind of midair transfer of strength, contact across a void, like the tangling of cable and steel between two lonely bridgeheads. I can’t think of a better approximation of the relation between reader and writer. Derived senses of fruitful exchange, of reciprocal sustenance, of welcome offered, oof grasp and interrelationship, of a slender span of bilateral attention along which things are given and received, still animate ttttthe word in its verb form: we entertain visitors, guests, ideas, prospects, theories, doubts, and grudges.<br>\n At some point, inevitably, as generations of hosts entertained generations of guests with banquets and feasts and displays of artifice, the idea of pleasure seeped into the pores of the word. And along with pleasure (just as inevitably, I suppose) came disapproval, a sense of hollowness and hangover, the saturnine doubtfulness that attaches to delight and artifice and show—to pleasure, that ambiguous gift. It’s partly the doubtfulness of pleasure that taints the name of entertainment. Pleasure is unreliable and transient. Pleasure is Lucy with the football. It is the roguish boyfriend who upends your heart with promises, touches you for twenty bucks, and then blows town. Pleasure is easily synthesized, mass-produced, individually wrapped. Its benefits do not endure, and so we come to mistrust them, or our taste for them.<br>\n The other taint is that of passivity. At some point in its history, the idea of entertainment lost its sense of mutuality, of exchange. One either entertains or is entertained, is the actor or the fan. As with all one-way relationships, grave imbalances accrue. The entertainer balloons with a dangerous need for approval, validation, love, and box office; while the one entertained sinks into a passive spectactorship, vacantly munching great big salty handfuls right from the foil bag. We can’t take pleasure in a work of art, not in good conscience, without accepting the implicit intention of the artist to please us. But somewhere along the course of the past century or so, as the great machinery of pleasure came online, turning out products that, however pleasurable, suffer increasingly from the ills of mass manufacture—spurious innovation, inferior materials, alienated labor, and an excess of market research—that intention came to seem suspect, unworthy, and somehow cold and hungry at its core, like the eyes of a brilliant comedian. Lunch counters, muffler shops, dinner theaters, they aim to please; but writers? No self-respecting literary genius, even an occasional maker of avowed entertainments like Graham Greene, would ever describe himself as primarily an “entertainer.” An entertainer is a man in a sequined dinner jacket, singing “She’s a Lady” to a hall filled with women rubber-banding their underpants up onto the stage.<br>\n Yet entertainment—as I define it, pleasure and all—remains the only sure means we have of bridging, or at least of feeling as if we have bridged, the gulf of consciousness that separates each of us from everybody else. The best response to those who would cheapen and exploit it is not to disparage or repudiate but to reclaim entertainment as a job fit for artists and for audiences, a two-way exchange of attention, experience, and the universal hunger for connection. The short story maps the most efficient path for spanning the chasm between two human skulls. Cartographers employ different types of maps—political, topographic, dot—to emphasize different kinds of information. These different types are complementary; taken together they increase our understanding. In other introductions to other collections of short stories, I have argued for the commonsense proposition that, in constructing our fictional maps, we ought not to restrict ourselves to one type or category. Science fiction, fantasy, crime fiction—all these genres and others have rich traditions in the American short story, reaching straight back to Poe and Hawthorne, our first great practitioners of the form. One of the pioneers of the modern “psychological” short story as we now generally understand it, Henry James, wrote so many out-and-out ghost stories that they fill an entire book. But the same process of commercialization and mass appeal that discredited entertainment, or the idea of literature as entertainment, also devastated our notion of the kinds of short stories that belong in college syllabi, prestigious magazines, or yearly anthologies of the best American short stories (another victory, in my view, for the enemies of pleasure, in their corporate or ivory towers). In spite of this general neglect by the literary mainstream, however, those other traditional genres remain viable and lively and powerful models of the short story, whether in the hands of a daring soul like Kelly Link or those of a crime novelist, like Dennis Lehane, who takes a brilliant chance on the form that brought us some of the best work that Hammett and Chandler ever did.<br>\n I guess that in the end all this talk of pleasure and entertainment is by way of acknowledging the obvious: I have no idea if these are the twenty best short stories published in the United States during 2004, or not. And neither do you. Or rather, you may feel very strongly that they are not, or that some of the stories here deserve the honor and some don’t. But as you make your assessment—as you judge the product of my judgment—you will be relying, whether consciously, unconsciously, or in full-blown denial, on the same fundamental criterion as that on which I relied: the degree to which each of these stories catches hold of you, banishes everything but the interplay of your imagination and the author’s, your ear and the author’s, your solitude and the author’s. That’s entertainment. Short stories entertain; they aim to please. These are the twenty stories that pleased me best.</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2005 by Houghton Mifflin.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Chabon reaches out toward genre fiction after all, he writes, a story's delights \"all boil down to entertainment, and its suave henchman, pleasure\" but he doesn't go so far as to alienate fans of more traditional stories in the lively latest volume of this venerable series. He begins with a Little League baseball story by Tom Perotta (\"The Smile on Happy Chang's Face\"), arguably a character study but a rousing sports piece too, and Dennis Lehane's \"Until Gwen\" follows \"Your father picks you up from prison in a stolen Dodge Neon, with an 8-ball of coke in the glove compartment and a hooker named Mandy in the back seat\" to stir things up a little. Kelly Link contributes an elegant haunted house tale, and Cory Doctorow serves up a \"piss-take\" on Orson Scott Card's \"Ender's Game\" with his story of online gaming, \"Anda's Game.\" Stories by Edward P. Jones, Tim Pratt, Charles D'Ambrosio and Tom Bissell skirt genre, too, though Chabon doesn't forget such Best American stalwarts as Alice Munro, Joy Williams, Joyce Carol Oates and newer writers in the more traditional vein. In the big pile of Best Ams, this one holds its own, even if yawn six of the stories come from the august New Yorker. (Oct.) Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>The always-excellent Houghton Mifflin \"Best,\" with an entertaining twist. Chabon offers a refreshing defense of \"entertainment\" in the introduction, arguing that determining the \"best\" stories is impossible. He instead presents those that simply pleased him most. The collection draws heavily from the requisite publications (the New Yorker, etc.) and the MFA feedline. Up-and-comers are rare. Working through the plentiful fractured-middle-class-family tales, we meet creepy animals (Kelly Link's lovely, haunted \"Stone Animals\" and David Mean's philosophy-infused \"Secret Goldfish\") and even creepier people (Joy Williams's razor-sharp strangeness in \"The Girls\" and Nathaniel Bellows's tender portrait of loneliness and near-pedophilia, \"First Four Measures\"), as well as more straightforward, beautifully realized characters, from Tom Perotta, Lynne Sharon Schwartz and the short form's impresario, Alice Munro. An equal number of stories feature exiles and the down-and-out and. Of these, Edward P. Jones's gritty, heartfelt prison tale \"Old Boys, Old Girls\" and Charles D'Ambrosio's spooky, endearing drifters in \"The Scheme of Things\" are notable, as are the immigrant tales from Rishi Reddi and David Bezmozgis. Linguistic innovation is evident throughout, from Reddi's striking rendition of Indian English to the musical speech of George Saunders's wonderful \"Bohemians.\" Genre-bending also appears throughout, at its best in the Calvino-esque series of parables in J. Robert Lennon's \"Eight Pieces for the Left Hand,\" and the good humor of Tim Pratt's Wild West fantasy \"Hart and Boot.\" Indeed, humor-from black-gallows to gentle chuckles-leavens the entire collection. Even when repetitive (two storiesabout neurotical, sensitive piano-playing young boys?), the offerings are consistently interesting and often wonderfully weird.\n\n</article>"

Ranging from early colonial times to the present, American Working-Class Literature presents more than 300 literary texts that exemplify this tradition. It demonstrates how American working people live, labor, struggle, express themselves, and give meaning to their experiences both inside and outside of the workplace. The only book of its kind, this groundbreaking anthology includes work not only by the industrial proletariat but also by slaves and unskilled workers, by those who work unpaid at home, and by workers in contemporary service industries. As diverse in race, gender, culture, and region as America's working class itself, the selections represent a wide range of genres including fiction, poetry, drama, memoir, oratory, journalism, letters, oral history, and songs. Works by little-known or anonymous authors are included alongside texts from such acclaimed writers as Frederick Douglass, Upton Sinclair, Tillie Olsen, Philip Levine, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Leslie Marmon Silko. A rich selection of contemporary writing includes Martin Espada's poem \"Alabanza\" about the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.<br>\n American Working-Class Literature is organized chronologically into seven sections that highlight key historical and cultural developments in working-class life. The book is enhanced by an editors' introduction, section introductions, and individual head notes for each selection that provide biographical and historical context. A timeline of working-class history, rich illustrations, sidebars, reading lists, and a bibliography of critical commentary are also included. This unique volume is ideal for courses in American literature, cultural and working-class studies, and labor history.</p>",

The definition of the \"diaspora\" given recently by the Haitian Embassy's Gerard Alphonse Ferere is \"any dispersal of people to foreign soils.\" But in Danticat's introduction, we also learn that the \"dyaspora\" is the \"floating homeland, the ideological one, join[ing] all Haitians living in the dyaspora.\" Poet Marc Christophe leads the selections with a poem on the sensory Haiti he remembers, \"the heated voice of peasant men/ who caress the earth/ with their fertile hands/ the supple steps of peasant women/ on top of the dew.\" In the chapter on migration, we learn about Gary Pierre-Pierre's interracial marriage and the reactions to it. Martine Bury tells a similar story in her essay, \"You and Me Against the World.\" The selections are varied, colorful, and interesting.

Not only is the anthology representative, but it also serves to focus on some of the chief issues in early American studies today.\" <br>\n— Rosemary Fithian Guruswamy, <i>Radford University</i>&nbsp;\"My overall reaction to this anthology is that it is one of the most thoughtfully organized and written anthologies of American literature that I have seen in recent years. Rich in visual materials, which are especially effective for an undergraduate audience, it is equally fulfilling in the content and choice of selections.\" — Sharon M. Harris, <i>University of Connecticut</i>&nbsp;\"I admire this anthology a great deal. But what recommends it, finally, is not simply its economies but the acuity of its choices, the unobtrusive depth of its learning, and its pedagogical and historical imaginativeness.\" — Richard Millington, <i>Smith College</i>&nbsp;\"Susan Belasco and Linck Johnson have done a fine job conceptualizing a kind of American literature anthology not currently available. Their focused attention to reading, writing and print culture will remind students (and all of us) of the significance of literature as a way of knowing. As I read I also considered whether the introductory American survey I teach would need significant revision if I were to use an anthology like this one. I found I could teach my course with their book.\" — Pattie Cowell, <i>Colorado State University</i>&nbsp;\"In sum, this text offers the best view of the cultural mosaic that is ‘American Literature’ that I have ever seen. I love the clear organization, and the various helpful apparati, especially the historical contextualizations of a work’s particular ‘place and time.’\" — Thomas Gannon, <i>University of Nebraska</i>&nbsp;\"I found this to be an excellent anthology, well-conceived and very well selected and edited, with some features that make it distinctive in the very crowded field of American literature anthologies. Its selectivity (resisting the imperative to include everything, as many modern American literature anthologies do) is a real virtue. I recommend it highly.\" — David M.

Ariel Levy writes in &#147;The Lesbian Bride&#8217;s Handbook&#8221; of her efforts to plan a party that accurately reflects her lifestyle (which she notes is &#147;not black-tie!&#8221;) as she confronts head-on what it means to be married. And Lauren Slater is off to &#147;Tripp Lake,&#8221; recounting the one summer she spent at camp&#151;a summer of color wars, horseback riding, and the &#147;wild sadness&#8221; that settled in her when she was away from home.<br> In the end, Gopnik believes that the only real ambition of an essayist is to be a master of our common life.

    "excerpt": "<br>\n<b><big>Foreword</big></b><br>\n<i><big>by David Lehman</big></i><br>\n<p>In a wonderful essay in <i>The Dyer's Hand</i> (1962) -- an essay written far in advance of the ubiquitous writing workshop -- W. H. Auden prescribed the curriculum of his \"daydream College for Bards.\" Matriculated students in the \"daydream college\" must learn at least one ancient and two modern languages. They have to memorize thousands of lines of verse. Forbidden from reading criticism, they must exercise their critical faculties by writing parodies. They need to take courses in prosody, rhetoric, and comparative philology. Most unconventionally, they are required to study three subjects from a varied group, including \"archaeology, mythology, liturgics, cooking,\" and they are expected also to take up gardening or to adopt a four-legged pet.</p>\n<p>While the proposed banning of literary criticism from the college library may go too far, I think Auden is right about a lot of things. The value of knowing a poem by heart lies not in the public recitation but in the inward recollection of the lines when one is in a vacant or a pensive mood; there is simply no better way to possess a poem than to memorize it. A good parody is an act of practical criticism, as instructive and more amusing than most. Among the most efficacious exercises are those that involve writing in set forms and handling various metrical and stanzaic patterns. I agree, too, on the value of such nonliterary activities as cooking and gardening, which in their creative processes and structures bear more than a passing resemblance to the act of writing. Given the sheer number of graduate writing programs in the country today -- urban or pastoral, low or high residency, fancy or no frills, traditional or innovative -- it's a wonder, in a way, that none has given Auden's curriculum a try.</p>\n<p>Auden begins \"The Poet &amp; the City\" with the observation that a great many young people of limited talent, \"when asked what they want to do in life,\" answer neither sensibly (\"I want to be a lawyer, an innkeeper, a farmer\") nor romantically (\"I want to be an explorer, a racing motorist, a missionary, President of the United States\"). Instead they want to become writers, \"creative\" writers. The phenomenon had long astonished and vexed the author. In \"The Prolific and the Devourer,\" written in 1939, the year Auden first took up residence in America, he asserts that the secret meaning of \"I want to write\" is \"I don't want to work.\" Art as a form of play, he adds, \"is the least dependent on the good-will of others and looks the easiest.\" For the shirkers, Auden's message is that you must work very hard not only at becoming a poet but at earning a living. He goes on to recommend learning a craft or taking up a trade that does not \"involve the manipulation of words,\" a very Audenesque piece of advice that his own industrious practice as an essayist and anthologist belies. Perhaps, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the only thing to do with good advice is pass it on and assume that it doesn't apply to you. Richard Howard, the guest editor of the 1995 volume in this series, recollects the time that \"Wystan [Auden's first name] scolded me for translating books from the French. He thought manual labor was a much more suitable idea.\" On another occasion, Auden voiced his opinion that \"poets should dress like businessmen,\" while he wore, in James Schuyler's words, \"an incredible peach / -colored nylon shirt.\"</p>\n<p>Such inconsistencies are amusing but do not affect the central point, and we may thank Auden for raising the whole question of what job options there are for, in his phrase, \"the average poet.\" Many young writers today can see their lives unfold in a seamless transition from one side of the classroom to the other without an intervening period of living in the place that professors sometimes call the \"quote-unquote real world.\" The importance of going out into the world and encountering its complexity and range of possibility is surely one thing we might stress in our latter-day College for Bards.</p>\n<p>The proliferation of graduate, degree-granting writing programs in the thirty-five years since Auden's death may not have surprised one so suspicious of the vanity of young writers. Yet even a critic of the workshop structure, centering as it does on the student rather than on canonical texts, might welcome the news that MFA programs continue to flourish -- if only because writing requires reading and because we may owe to these programs the perpetuation of the art that we practice and the \"influences\" we honor and sometimes contend with like uncles and aunts and grandparents. The Association of Writing Programs (AWP) held its annual conference in New York City in 2008, and the sold-out event, attracting more participants and book exhibits than any in the organization's history, was nothing if not a sign of a profession in vigorous health. In undergraduate education, too, creative writing has become a vital force. The Association of Departments of English (ADE), a branch of the Modern Languages Association (MLA), periodically takes up a recurrent problem: the decline in the percentage of undergraduates majoring in English.1 In response to the predicament, a number of English departments have expanded their offerings in creative writing. This has proved a shrewd maneuver. The success of the gambit attests not just to the lure of self-expression but to the assertion of the pleasure principle in matters of art and literature. Who would not choose the pleasure of making narratives and lyrics if the alternative is to \"problematize a text\"?</p>\n<p>We who teach writing know how pure and strong the literary impulse remains among our students. We are impressed with their ambition and their commitment. But we know also that reading and writing exist in a symbiotic relationship, and many of us wonder how it came about that even some of our most talented and energetic young writers got through college with having read so little. When I wrote <i>Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man</i> (1991), the joke in currency was that if you crossed a mafioso and a deconstructionist, what you got was someone who makes you \"an offer that you can't understand.\" The beauty of the joke was that it did three things at once: it confirmed the iconic status of <i>The Godfather</i>; it made the point that jargon and abstruse terminology result in incomprehensible prose; and it attributed a mob mentality to a clique that was reputedly skillful, even ruthless, at the academic game of chutes and tenure ladders. I worried then that the hegemony of critical theory may serve to rationalize and would probably accelerate the neglect of authors and the decay of practical criticism. It gives the maker of that prediction little satisfaction to see it come true.</p>\n<p>Something larger than the ideological and political conflicts between and within academic departments is at stake here. In the real culture war, the war for the survival of the literary culture, the dummies seem to be winning. There are days when even an unflagging champion of the written word may fear that his or her best efforts may turn out to have the same effect as a prayer to the patron saint of lost causes. The force against literacy in the old-fashioned sense of reading books, understanding traditions, and recollecting history is, in the old-fashioned sense, awesome. In 2004 the National Endowment for the Arts issued its grim report <i>Reading at Risk</i>, and a year ago the NEA followed up with <i>To Read or Not to Read</i>. The reports make the case that \"reading skills\" correlate directly to individual achievement and career success, not to mention the health of the culture and the education of the citizenry. And by all standards, we are failing. The percentage of the U.S. population that reads books went down from an estimated 61 percent in 1992 to under 57 percent ten years later. That's a slow but steady rate of decline. There's little surprise and less comfort in learning that the rate of decline is faster when it comes to works of fiction and poetry. Between 1982 and 2002, the percentage of the population that had read a \"creative\" book in the previous twelve months went down from 56.9 to 46.7. \"More alarming [than the decline in newspaper circulation and in household spending on books] are indications that Americans are losing not just the will to read but even the ability,\" Caleb Crain writes in <i>The New Yorker</i>. Crain summarizes the view of some sociologists that reading books for pleasure may someday become \"an increasingly arcane hobby.\"2 If one culprit among many is television, one effect is the \"dumbing down\" of culture -- a trend so powerful it brought a new phrase into currency. People know astoundingly little about, say, American history, and this (they think) is no big deal. Every now and then an author risks being called a \"curmudgeon\" or a \"crank\" for airing misgivings about this state of affairs, while indulging the guilty pleasure of circulating anecdotes of epic American ignorance. Patricia Cohen's <i>New York Times</i> piece on Susan Jacoby's book <i>The Age of American Unreason</i> begins with the \"adorable platinum blonde\" who thought that Europe was a country. She was a contestant on the FOX game show <i>Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?</i> -- the whole premise of which is that Americans are stupider than ever and reveling in it. Jacoby herself says she wrote her book because (in Cohen's paraphrase) \"anti-intellectualism (the attitude that 'too much learning can be a dangerous thing') and anti-rationalism ('the idea that there is no such things as evidence or fact, just opinion') have fused in a particularly insidious way.\" Jacoby's immediate trigger was an overheard conversation in which one well-dressed man told another that \"Pearl Harbor\" \"was when the Vietnamese dropped bombs in a harbor, and it started the Vietnam War.\"3</p>\n<p>In the teeth of an epidemic of ignorance, we must decide what and how to teach the young people who come to us convinced that they have a poetic vocation. We should encourage them to read widely -- to read everything they can. But we should assuredly not mock anyone for what they do not know or have not yet read. Rather, respond with ardor to their list of unread books: for though rereading is a great art, nothing can beat the first time you live with <i>Crime and Punishment</i> or Keats's odes and letters or Genesis or Homer or Dante or Emily Dickinson or Byron's <i>Don Juan</i>. It's a list-maker's delight, devising the syllabus for a course on, say, what Keats called the \"vale of soul-making\" -- the making of a poet. We may take as our motto this line from Ben Jonson's ode to the memory of Shakespeare: \"For a good poet's made, as well as born.\" On my syllabus I'd include some of the aforementioned works, as well as Emerson's essays, Gertrude Stein's lectures and <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i>, and Rilke's <i>Letters to a Young Poet</i>. What, gentle reader, would you choose?</p>\n<p>Our obligations to our students do not stop at texts and assignments, instruction on the preparation of a manuscript, information about the literary marketplace, methods of dealing with writer's block, models for how to disagree without resort to fisticuffs. By our example we can prove that a conversation or debate about poetry need not reflect the corrosive nature of the national political discourse. There is also the need for students -- for all of us, really -- to come to terms with the likelihood of rejection and the inevitability of injustice. Someday someone else in the room will win the award or the fellowship or the honor that you deserved. But envy is always an error, and to win a prize or an award is not the reason you wrote poetry in the first place. Return to that original impulse. Don't give in to resentment and bitterness, the enemies of poetry. We could probably devote an entire course in the \"daydream College\" to one aphorism from Auden's prologue to The Dyer's Hand: \"No poet or novelist wishes he were the only one who ever lived, but most of them wish they were the only one alive, and quite a number fondly believe their wish has been granted.\"4</p>\n<p>When the <i>Best American Poetry</i> series was new, I would use this space to explain our rules and procedures. Years have gone by since I last explained that each year a different guest editor, himself or herself a distinguished poet, chooses the seventy-five poems in a volume, and that usually the seventy-five poems are by as many poets, though there have been exceptions (1996 and 2007, for example). It's unwise to take too much for granted, and it can't hurt to reiterate here that we construe \"American\" as broadly as possible, counting resident aliens and temporary residents (if the guest editor feels passionately about the poem) and routinely including Canadian poets. Since the 1991 volume, poems have been chosen exclusively from print or electronic magazines and periodicals, not from individual books, collections, or anthologies. Translations are ineligible. The poets are asked to comment on their poems, and the majority of them do so, transforming the genre of contributors' notes from an afterthought into a feature of the anthology that many readers find particularly valuable. The guest editor makes the selections and contributes an introductory essay; the series editor contributes a foreword, works with the guest editor in ways that vary from year to year, and assembles the manuscript. The guest editor's decisions are final and definitive.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the most important decision we have to make annually is the identity of the person who will put his or her stamp on a volume in a series that chronicles the taste of our leading practitioners. Honored among his peers, Charles Wright seemed a natural for this editorial job and brought a keen sense of responsibility to it. He worked hard to be ecumenical, balancing the desire to be inclusive with the unrelenting need to favor excellence. Born in Pickwick Dam, Tennessee, Wright discovered his poetic vocation while serving in U.S. Army Intelligence in Italy in the 1950s. After completing four years of active duty, he left the army in 1961 and soon was studying with Donald Justice at the University of Iowa. Since 1983 Wright has taught at the University of Virginia. His poetry has a spiritual, even a religious flavor -- \"each line is a station of the cross,\" he has said -- though it calls to mind a religion based on doubt more than faith. In a poem in Scar Tissue (2006), Wright depicts himself as a song and dance man -- but one who has the west wind whistling and Dante's souls dancing in his brain. The urge to pray outlasts the conviction that God will hear the prayer. Yet the capital G in the opening phrase of this arresting passage performs a little miracle of poetic transformation:</p>\n<blockquote>A God-fearing agnostic, \n<p>I tend to look in the corners of things,</p>\n<p>Those out-of-the-way places,</p>\n<p>The half-dark and half-hidden,</p>\n<p>the passed-by and over-looked,</p>\n<p>Whenever I want to be sure I can't find something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As this excerpt from \"Confessions of a Song and Dance Man\" illustrates, Wright has a distinctive way of breaking his lines in the middle: the second half begins where the first left off, one line space lower on the page. The device in his hands is a potent means of punctuating space, as well suited to his poetic pursuits as A. R. Ammons's colons are to his project of \"colonizing\" the known universe.</p>\n<p>The year 2007 was favorable for guest editors past and present of <i>The Best American Poetry</i>. Charles Simic, who edited <i>The Best American Poetry 1992</i>, succeeded Donald Hall (BAP 1989) as U.S. poet laureate. (Counting Simic, seven <i>Best American Poetry</i> guest editors have held the post.) During that same week in August, the Academy of American Poets announced that Simic had won this year's prestigious Wallace Stevens Award. Robert Hass (<i>BAP 2001</i>) garnered the National Book Award and a Pulitzer for <i>Time and Materials</i>. Paul Muldoon (<i>BAP 2005</i>) became poetry editor of <i>The New Yorker</i>. John Ashbery (<i>BAP 1988</i>) was named poet laureate of MTV. And the 2007 Griffin Prize went to Charles Wright for <i>Scar Tissue</i>.</p>\n<p>On February 14, 2008, Scribner published <i>The Best American Erotic Poems: From 1800 to the Present</i>. On the same day, an assistant principal of a high school in Springfield, Ohio, was suspended (and was eventually obliged to resign) when school officials learned he had posted erotic poems on the net under the pseudonym Antonio Love. This all happened (the local newscast reported) \"after a parent complained about the alleged poetry.\" (The <i>alleged</i> there is a final twist of the knife.) Who says that hot poems can't get you into trouble in 2008? Poetry remains a bad influence all these years after Plato banished the poets from his ideal republic.</p>\n<p> Copyright © 2008 by David Lehman</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p><P>The <i>Best American Poetry</i> series is a beloved mainstay of American poetry.

He has gathered an astonishing selection of work that includes new poems by Carolyn Forch&#233;, Jorie Graham, Louise Gl&#252;ck, Frank Bidart, Frederick Seidel, Patti Smith, and Kevin Young and showcases a dazzling array of rising stars like Joshua Beckman, Erica Dawson, and Alex Lemon.<P>With captivating and revelatory notes from the poets on their works and sage and erudite introductory essays by Wright and series editor David Lehman, <i>The Best American Poetry 2008</i> will be read, discussed, debated, and prized for years to come.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>In his bullet-pointed introduction to this year's volume in this popular annual anthology series, prolific Pulitzer winner Wright makes it known that he is interested in emotional intensity, and its capacity to give poems shape and beauty, more than in any particular aesthetic camp: \"cleverness is not what endures.

    "synopsis": "<p><p>In this exciting new collection, William Nack, veteran sportswriter and author of the classic Secretariat, honors the year s finest sports journalism and thus upholds the tradition that began seventeen years ago, with David Halberstam at the helm. In these pages, you will find the most provocative, compelling, tragic, and triumphant moments in sports from 2007, captured by the knights of the keyboard who make sports come alive for us day after day, week after week, year after year. Here you ll find Paul Solotaroff s excellent and uncompromising take on the neglect that a growing number of crippled NFL players continually face from the NFL players union. Jeanne Marie Laskas s G-L-O-R-Y! offers a rousing inside look at the pregame rituals of the Cincinnati Bengals cheerleaders. A riveting online diary by Wright Thompson reveals a bleak and merciless landscape in China, which that country s government would rather not have the world see during preparations for the Olympics. Nack finds a place for the fascinating offbeat story as well as the sensational. Alongside Eli Saslow s captivating article about an obscure seventeenth-century sport, similar to a giant rugby scrum, carried out in the streets of Kirkwall, Scotland, stands Franz Lidz s scoop of the year, a controversial and rare look into the life of George Steinbrenner, baseball s largest but recently most enigmatic figure. This year s collection marks another wonderful addition to one of the most consistently satisfying titles in the Best American series (Booklist). Contributors include Scott Price, Rick Bragg, Gary Smith, J.R. Moehringer, and others.</p></p>",

    "overview": "<p>Sometimes the crack of the bat or the roar of the crowd fails to capture the meaning of sports as athletes themselves understand it. Books about sports have ignored this dimension of the subject, particularly the athletes’ own autobiographical accounts. &nbsp;In <i>Sporting Lives</i>, &nbsp;the first book to examine the two popular realms of sports and autobiography, James Pipkin looks at recurring patterns found in athletes’ accounts of their lives and sporting experiences, examining language, metaphor, rhetorical strategies, and other elements to analyze sports from the inside out.</p>\n<p><i>Sporting Lives</i> takes a fresh look at memoirs from baseball, football, basketball, golf, and other sports to explore how American athletes see themselves: not only how those images mesh with popular perceptions of them as heroes or celebrities but also how their accounts differ from those of sports journalists and other outsiders. Drawing on the life stories of such well-known figures as Wilt Chamberlain, Babe Ruth, and Martina Navratilova—both as-told-to and self-authored works—Pipkin follows players from the “echoing green” of eternal youth to the sometimes cultlike and isolated status of fame, interpreting recurring patterns both in the living of their lives and in the telling of them. He even considers Dennis Rodman’s four autobiographies to show how the contradictions of his self-portrayals reflect the Janus-faced quality of sports in the era of celebrity culture.</p>\n<p>As Pipkin shows, the life of the athlete involves more than mere athleticism; it is also a world of nostalgia and sentiment, missed opportunities and lost youth. He sheds light on athletes’ common obsession with youth and body image—including gender and racial considerations—and explores their descriptions of being “in a zone,” that transcendent state when everything seems to click. And he considers the time that all athletes dread, when their bodies begin to betray them . . . and the cheering stops.</p>\n<p>While the lives of athletes may often suggest the magic of Peter Pan, Pipkin’s engaging study reveals that they are in many ways more like the Lost Boys. <i>Sporting Lives</i> shows that the meaning of sports is intertwined with the telling. It is both an eminently readable book for fans and a critically sophisticated analysis that will engage scholars of literature, sports or media studies, and American popular culture.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>\"Alan and I had been out on the water now for more than two hours, and were starting to tire. We began drifting more and more, letting the current propel us. I put my hand back into the water, and for a moment imagined myself connected to the Atlantic Ocean a few miles away. I felt myself sweep past the small beaches along the creek's shore, past the white yachts in the marinas on Barnegat Bay, past the tiny Sedge Islands with their myriad wildlife, and beyond the shoals of the shifting barrier islands, into the open ocean. From the seat of this aluminum canoe, I felt as if I were connected to all the Jersey Shore&#151;to all creation, in fact. I tilted my face toward the sun and smiled.\"<br> &#151;from \"Canoeing Down Cedar Creek\" <p>\"The wind howls, and the sand responds. Everything is in flux. The beach you step on today will not be the same one you step on tomorrow. But you will never know it. Nature repeats itself endlessly, ever changing, ever unchanged.\"<br> &#151;from \"A Winter s Sketch\" <p>Jersey Shore Publications is pleased to bring you To The Shore Once More, Volume II, the sequel and companion volume to the bestseller, To The Shore Once More.<P> Containing more pages and artwork than Volume I (with 180 pages of text and 144 full-color paintings by more than forty area artists), this coffee table book of prose, poetry, and works of art takes readers on a journey down the Jersey Shore&#151;from the tip of Sandy Hook to the point of Cape May. <P> Join once more acclaimed author and poet, Frank Finale, and his family on a journey through the past and present as he once again captures life along the shore while exploring universal themes that touch us all. These graceful personal essays and poems elicit an emotional response and lingering memory. They are also perfect for reading aloud throughout the year and, as with Volume I, may even become a family tradition in years to come! <P> The essays and poems are organized from north to south taking place in all four seasons in many of the towns and regions along the coast including Highlands, Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, Bradley Beach, Belmar, Spring Lake, Point Pleasant, Seaside, Island Beach, the Toms River area, Bayville, Long Beach Island, the Pine Barrens, Brigantine, Atlantic City, and Cape May. <P> Also inside, you ll find resplendent, full color paintings of some of the loveliest landmarks and locations at the Jersey Shore.

    "excerpt": "<p>Boys feel wild; they love their tree houses, their wild spots in the woods, they all want to go down to the river, with Huck, away from domesticating aunts. Boys love to see some wildness in their fathers, to see their fathers dancing or carrying on. Some boys are so afraid that they will become domestic that they become savage, not wild.</p>\n<p>The marks of wildness are love of nature, especially its silence, a voice box free to say spontaneous things, an exuberance, a love of \"the edge,\" the willingness to admit the \"three strange angels\" that Lawrence speaks of. Yeats realized searching Roman and Greek texts that even Cicero, considered middle of the road, was much wilder than any of his friends; the wild man is not mad like a criminal or mad like a psychotic, but \"Mad as the mist and snow.</p>\n<p>How many years ago</p>\n<p>Were you and I unlettered lads</p>\n<p>Mad as the mist and snow?</p>\n<p>This question does not mean that wildness is restricted to childishness, or is dominated by so-called primitive emotions, or amounts to atavism. The wildness of nature is highly sophisticated.</p>\n<p>Jung remarked, \"It is difficult to say to anybody you should.... become acquainted with your animal, because people think it is a sort of lunatic asylum, they think the animal is jumping over walls and raising hell all over town. Yet the animal ... is pious, it follows the path with great regularity.... Only man is extravagant . . .\" (Visions Seminar 1, P. 282).</p>\n<p>Thoreau says, \"In literature it is only the wild that attracts us.\" King Lear attracts us, the dervish, the Zen laugher. The civilized eve of man has become dulled, unable to take in the natural wildness of the planet. Blake says, \"Theroaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of eternity, too great for the eve of man.\"</p>\n<p>Each of us wants to get in touch not so much with the harsh rebel, the self-destroying outsider, as with the beauty of what the Sufis call \"Joseph,\" the round-faced troublemaker.</p>\n<p>Pharaoh and the whole Egyptian world</p>\n<p>collapsed for such a Joseph.</p>\n<p>I'd gladly spend years getting word</p>\n<p>of him, even third or fourth hand.</p>\n<p>One of the great preservers of wildness is the Sufi poet Rumi, who founded the whirling dervishes. When he says wine, he doesn't mean physical wine, but the feeling of ecstasy that unites people after midnight and encourages them to \"be thrown into the fire\":</p>\n<p>Two strong impulses: One</p>\n<p>to drink long and deep,</p>\n<p>the other,</p>\n<p>not to sober up too soon.</p>\n<p>One can keep one's job and still be wild; one can remain married and still be wild; one can live in cities and remain wild. What is needed is a soul discipline that Gan, Snyder calls \"practice of the wild\"-Wendell Berry understands it well. Garcia Lorca practices it by the way he leaps from one image to the next, surefooted as a cat. \"What is the knocking?\" Lawrence says.</p>\n<p>What is the knocking at the door in the night?</p>\n<p>It is somebody wants to do us harm.</p>\n<p>No, no, it is the three strange angels.</p>\n<p>Admit them, admit them.</p>\n<p>The practice is a secret that not all understand, but many blues musicians and jazz soloists and lovers understand it. \"Whoever's not killed for love is dead meat.\"</p>\n<br>\n<br>\nR.B.<br>\n<br>\n<p>DANSE RUSSE</p>\n<p>If when my wife is sleeping</p>\n<p>and the baby and Kathleen</p>\n<p>are sleeping</p>\n<p>and the sun is a flame-white disc</p>\n<p>in silken mists</p>\n<p>above shining trees,-</p>\n<p>if I in my north room</p>\n<p>dance naked, grotesquely</p>\n<p>before my mirror</p>\n<p>waving my shirt round my head</p>\n<p>and singing softly to myself:</p>\n<p>\"I am lonely, lonely.</p>\n<p>I was born to be lonely,</p>\n<p>I am best so!\"</p>\n<p>If I admire my arms, my face,</p>\n<p>my shoulders, flanks, buttocks</p>\n<p>against the yellow drawn shades,</p>\n<p>Who shall say I am not</p>\n<p>the happy genius of my household?</p>\n<p>WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS</p>\n<p>SMELL!</p>\n<p>Oh strong-ridged and deeply hollowed</p>\n<p>nose of mine! what will you not be smelling?</p>\n<p>What tactless asses we are, you and I boney nose</p>\n<p>always indiscriminate, always unashamed,</p>\n<p>and now it is the souring flowers of the bedraggled</p>\n<p>poplars: a festering pulp on the wet earth</p>\n<p>beneath them.

To subsume poems under a single theme is always risky, and to enroll them in a cause detracts from their artistic nature. The poets selected here--everyone from Hesiod to Yeats, Li Po to Dickinson--are first-rate, but for that very reason their work is multi-dimensional, thus hardly about, let alone ``for,'' men. The editors have organized the book into subjects such as ``Mother and Great Mother,'' war, father, ``Wildness'' and love. Their introductions to each section too often leap from the reality of men's feelings to abstractions, Jungian archetypes and myths. As advice for reading poems, their observation that ``for men depression is sometimes the entrance to the soul'' hardly seems helpful, and as psychology it comes close to the old masculine cliche that pain is good and one should suffer one's feelings stoically. But even if the anthology is all too manly, it contains many great poems which speak to us all regardless of sex. And, like the men's movement itself, the book bespeaks a genuine interest in overhauling conventional notions about what is masculine. Bly ( Iron John ) is a poet; Hillman ( Re-Visioning Psychology ) is a psychologist; Meade is a scholar of myth. $50,000 ad/promo. (Sept.)</p>",

Contributing insightful introductions to each section, the editors select more than 300 Jungian-intuitive poems (more effectively heard aloud) by such writers as Lorca, Neruda, Ponge, Rilke, and Vallejo. These writers are receptive to the archetypal wisdom of the unconscious, ``that vision which is the ground of all initiations.'' Shopworn anthology pieces like ``Miniver Cheevy'' don't capture ``moments when we feel outside time, seized by a longing'' as effectively as works by unfamiliar authors (Olav H. Hauge, Gyula Illyes, Haki Madhubuti, Heinz Pasman), songs of primitive peoples, and dreamlike prose excerpts expressing the conflicting emotions that comprise a man's New Age identity.-- Frank Allen, West Virginia State Coll., Institute\n\n</article>"

While we can all quibble about inclusions and exclusions (even in a 1,000-page selection), Lehman's eye--and his ear--have produced a work that will last us well into the new century.\"--Ashton Nichols, <em>Dickinson College</em></p>\n<p>\"It can't get much better than this.\"--Rochelle Moore, <em>Associated Content</em></p>\n<p>\"The book is not only a sound historical survey, but also gives the reader a powerful taste of poetry's impact upon the wider world.\"--<em>The Economist</em></p>\n<p>\"Indeed, for the reader otherwise disinclined to pick up a volume of poetry, you may also find yourself enjoying the selections in this collection. It will be a purchase that will stay with you far longer than any meal at a fancy restaurant upon which you might spend the money.

Here she chronologically excerpts the perhaps 16 volumes of the Legend of Duluoz to create a map of Kerouac's oeuvre, which, according to the publisher, he had planned before his death. She supports it not only with fat slices of Kerouac's best writing but also with an investigation into his bop prosody that gives his jazz-riff style a new currency. In fact, this volume may deal a fist in the face of the English sentence, because Kerouac's revamping of the sentence is so song-filled and emotion-ridden that its properties could well do for American prose what Whitman did for verse: give it new life. An alcoholic jamming by candlelight with scotch and pot on the kitchen table, he mixes jazz with Rimbaud's derangement of the senses to create a vehicle for his own anguish as he recollects his life on the run. The Portable shows Kerouac at his best as a riff artist but also gathers to stronger effect than any single Kerouac novel. Includes selections from his poetry and experimental novels. (Mar.)</p>",

Vasquez <br>&bull; Ana Lydia Vega</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>While it could have been more strictly organized (i.e., vaguely thematic chapters include ``History and Politics'' and ``Anxiety and Assimilation,'' currents present in almost every piece), this excellent anthology of essays, fiction, poetry, screenplays and other works by writers of Puerto Rican heritage shimmers with interesting reading. In a buoyant introduction, Santiago describes his own, youthful discovery of Puerto Rican writers-``the first book I read by a Puerto Rican author was the one the Jesuits at Xavier had denounced as pornographic and prejudiced against whites. I knew it had to be good''-and explains why their writing continues to feel ``subversive.'' Jesus Colon fluidly combines a thumbnail history of the island's oppression with an explanation of why it takes a lot of effort before a Puerto Rican will ``ask you to have a cup of black coffee with him in his own kitchen.'' In ``Palante! Young Lords,'' Pablo Guzman recounts the founding of the Young Lords Party, based on the Black Panthers. With academic clarity, Clara E. Rodriguez examines racial background in ``Puerto Ricans: Between Black and White,'' a theme Julia de Burgos treats more succinctly and emotionally in poetry.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                            </h4>While it could have been more strictly organized (i.e., vaguely thematic chapters include ``History and Politics'' and ``Anxiety and Assimilation,'' currents present in almost every piece), this excellent anthology of essays, fiction, poetry, screenplays and other works by writers of Puerto Rican heritage shimmers with interesting reading. In a buoyant introduction, Santiago describes his own, youthful discovery of Puerto Rican writers-``the first book I read by a Puerto Rican author was the one the Jesuits at Xavier had denounced as pornographic and prejudiced against whites. I knew it had to be good''-and explains why their writing continues to feel ``subversive.'' Jesus Colon fluidly combines a thumbnail history of the island's oppression with an explanation of why it takes a lot of effort before a Puerto Rican will ``ask you to have a cup of black coffee with him in his own kitchen.'' In ``Palante! Young Lords,'' Pablo Guzman recounts the founding of the Young Lords Party, based on the Black Panthers. With academic clarity, Clara E. Rodriguez examines racial background in ``Puerto Ricans: Between Black and White,'' a theme Julia de Burgos treats more succinctly and emotionally in poetry. Women are well represented here, although they tend to write about being women specifically. In general, the variety is impressive: Ana Lydia Vega, Martin Espada, Geraldo Rivera, a transcript of a Freddie Prinze monologue and a serious essay by the comedian's mother. Santiago has gracefully managed to pull together a collection that presents a united front while perserving the diversity of the individual voices. (Sept.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Boricua is a Puerto Rican term of endearment for other Puerto Ricans, and this anthology represents the sentiment well. Edited by a writer for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, it gathers 50 selections of 19th- and 20th-century literature of all sorts: poetry, fiction, essays, screenplays, speeches, and more. Some of the works were originally written in Spanish and some in English, but they are all representative of Puerto Rican life, history, politics, and culture both in Puerto Rico and in the United States. While authors like Piri Thomas and Judith Ortiz Cofer will be familiar, others, such as Jos de Diego and Pedor Albiza Campes, will be new to most non-Puerto Rican readers. Certain selections highlight media figures, including Freddie Prinze, Jos Torres, and Geraldo Rivera. Appropriate for comprehensive Latino collections in public libraries.-Mary Margaret Benson, Linfield Coll. Lib., McMinville, Ore.\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<p>As perhaps never before in its extraordinary history, New York has captured the American imagination. This major anthology brings together not only the best literary writing about New York -- from O. Henry, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Steinbeck, Paul Auster, and James Baldwin, among many others -- but also the most revealing essays by politicians, philosophers, city planners, social critics, visitors, immigrants, journalists, and historians.</p>\n<p>The anthology begins with an account of Henry Hudson's voyage in 1609 and ends with an essay written especially for this book by John P. Avlon, former Mayor Rudolph Guiliani's speechwriter, called \"The Resilient City,\" on the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center as observed from City Hall. The editors have chosen some familiar favorites, such as Washington Irving's <i>A History of New York</i> and Walt Whitman's \"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\" as well as lesser-known literary and historical gems, such as Frederick Law Olmsted's plan for Central Park and Cynthia Ozick's \"The Synthetic Sublime\" -- an updated answer to E. B. White's classic essay <i>Here Is New York</i>, which is also included. The variety and originality of the selections in Empire City offer a captivating account of New York's growth, and reveal often forgotten aspects of its political, literary, and social history.</p>\n<p> Columbia University Press</p>",

    "excerpt": "White people have not always been \"white,\" nor will they always be \"white.\" It is a political alliance. Things will change.<br>\nAMOJA THREE RIVERS\n<p>Consider a slave on the auction block, awaiting sale. Imagine the slave being seen, indeed examined, by the potential bidders. Imagine what she felt. Think of her trembling and crying, breaking down, even fighting back. Such attempts to imagine looking in on the auction block and to empathize with those for sale have found a hard-won place in the mainstream of American culture. But little prepares us to see her as looking out, as studying the bidders. And yet, as recent and imaginative research has shown, slaves on the block often searched out every clue in sizing up the whites who would own them.1 Did that scar represent a history of violence? What did that leer suggest? Was that accent familiar, or did it point to the possibility of being transported great distances, away from family and to the master's home? Did those clothes mean great wealth, declining fortunes, or poor whiteness? What could be learned of the buyers from other slaves? What strategies of self-presentation would discourage the attention of the bidder most feared, or encourage the potential buyer judged to be the best of terrible options?</p>\n<p>When Langston Hughes published <i>The Ways of White Folks</i> some sixty years after the end of slavery, he featured the short story \"Slave on the Block\" near the book's outset. Set in early-twentieth-century New York City, not the antebellum South, and describing the experiences of a black servant rather than a slave, Hughes's story nonetheless claimed the angle of vision from the auction block as indispensable in describing how African Americans have learned about white ways.2 In fact, the drama of the auction block highlights many of the major themes included in this volume regarding how African Americans have thought about and studied whiteness. The deep associations of whiteness with terror and with property were sharply posed at the point of sale. The auction block gave flesh to questions of sexual exploitation and of gender. Its stark realities laid bare the urgent imperative for slaves to penetrate the psychologies of whites and their necessity to make distinctions even among white slave buyers. All of these themes and more figure prominently in African-American thought concerning whiteness, and deserve our attention here.</p>\n<p>But few Americans have ever considered the idea that African- Americans are extremely knowledgeable about whites and whiteness. In the mainstream of American culture, and certainly in intellectual circles, a rough and unproductive division of labor exists where the claiming of expert knowledge and commonsense wisdom on race are concerned. White writers have long been positioned as the leading and most dispassionate investigators of the lives, values, and abilities of people of color. White writing about whiteness is rarer, with discussions of what it means to be human standing in for considerations of how racial identity influences white lives. Writers of color, and most notably African-American writers, are cast as providing insight, often presumed to be highly subjective, of what it is like to be \"a minority.\" Lost in this destructive shuffle is the fact that from folktales onward African Americans have been among the nation's keenest students of white consciousness and white behavior.</p>\n<p>A story about each of the two greatest modern writers on whiteness in the United States, Toni Morrison and James Baldwin, allows us to see how African-American knowledge of whites is created and suppressed. In 1993, the journalist Bill Moyers asked Morrison when she would start writing about white people. Morrison wanted no part of Moyers's invitation to move into the white center of literary culture. She pledged to \"stay out here at the margin and let the center come looking for me.\" Morrison had, however, already written considerably about whites, both in fictional work like \"Recitatif\" and in the brilliant 1990 volume <i>Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination.</i>3 That challenging book was so little appreciated that Moyers could still ask when the writing on whites was to come. The fact that she had written the most important volume on whiteness published in this decade did not so much as establish Morrison's interest in the subject in the eyes of a relatively sophisticated observer of race in the United States like Moyers.</p>\n<p>At nineteen, James Baldwin's visits to the Apollo Theatre, an art film house on 42nd Street in New York City, left him paralyzed by a terror born of looking into the faces of the white, gay male clientele there. The gay men he saw seemed \"so far from being or resembling faggots.\" Indeed he thought that they \"looked and sounded like vigilantes who banded together on weekends to beat faggots up.\" After much suffering, he found that it was often true that the men alternated between gay sexuality and homophobic violence. Baldwin situated his knowledge in the position from which he observed the men. He had \"seen them in the men's room, sometimes on their knees, peering up into the stalls.\" But his racial position also mattered. \"I might not have learned this had I been a white boy,\" he later wrote, regarding his knowledge of the coexistence of sex and violence, \"but sometimes a white man will tell a black boy anything, everything, weeping briny tears. He knows that a black boy can never betray him, for no one will believe his testimony.\"4 Baldwin's reminiscences complicate our tasks. They suggest that Moyers's dismissal of Morrison's work on whiteness might typify a larger pattern of the ways in which whites disbelieve and/or disregard how much African Americans know about them. Indeed, for Baldwin, the wholesale dismissal by whites of African-American expertise regarding whiteness was one critical condition under which such knowledge could be obtained.</p>\n<p>At times African Americans have boldly claimed their expertise on whiteness. In the World War One era, James Weldon Johnson would assert as a \"fact\" that \"colored people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them.\" A decade later, the African-American journalist and novelist George S. Schuyler held, \"While the average Nordic knows nothing of how Negroes actually live and what they think, the Negroes know the Nordic intimately.\" The claims advanced by Johnson and Schuyler are serious and well-grounded, despite the fact that they would seem very unfamiliar and counterintuitive to most whites. Schuyler explained the insights of Black thinkers into \"white lives\" by observing that \"blacks haven't been working with or for white folks all these years for nothing.\" W.E.B. Du Bois in <i>Darkwater</i> and bell hooks in <i>Black Looks</i> similarly emphasize the servants' ability to know the families for whom they work.5 The contemporary mystery writer Barbara Neely captures this point wonderfully as her domestic worker/detective hero, Blanche White, solves murders by deploying her intimate knowledge of whites. Long experience with violence and sexual exploitation, Ida B. Wells-Barnett and Frederick Douglass argued, perfectly situated African-American Southerners to deflate the claims to chivalry, restraint, and civilization made by white males of that region. The drama and tragedy of passing as white, which is the subject of a large literature usually seen as portraying an exotic part of Black life, also turned on the close observation of white lives. Thus it should be no surprise that the legal theorist Cheryl Harris has recently used histories of passing by a family member to open discussions of the dynamics of white society.6</p>\n<p>What bell hooks describes as the fantastic white ability to imagine \"that black people cannot see them\" constitutes a white illusion at once durable, powerful, and fragile. It exists alongside a profound fear of actually being seen by people of color. As Baldwin argued, \". . . a vast amount of the energy that goes into what we call the Negro problem is produced by the white man's desire not to be judged by those who are not white.\" From the beatings of house slaves who knew too much to the lynchings of African Americans thought to look too long, safety has often turned not just on being unseen, but also on being perceived as unseeing. Richard Wright's mother knew whereof she spoke when she responded fiercely and negatively to his apparently simple youthful question, \"Can I go peep at the white folks?\" The law under slavery went to considerable pains to keep slaves from testifying against, or even about, whites. After emancipation, keeping African Americans off juries became a central focus of racist state policy.7 Discounting and suppressing the knowledge of whiteness held by people of color was not just a byproduct of white supremacy but an imperative of racial domination.</p>\n<p>The exposure of the illusion that Blacks did not see and know whites was too troubling to be countenanced, even if indications of its implausibility came from white authors centrally placed within the canon of Western philosophy and literature. If Hegel's celebrated early-nineteenth-century reflections on \"lordship and bondage\" applied to slavery and racial oppression, white mastery was futile and the denial of African-American knowledge of whites was ridiculous. Hegel saw the slave as living always with the knowledge of the master's deadly power. Slaves therefore necessarily thought deeply about the dynamics of lordship and bondage. The master could afford a lofty ignorance. As the slaves labored, stood in fear, and learned, they also \"worked on\" escaping their chains. This probing analysis, philosophers are anxious to tell us, represented Hegel's grappling with broad issues of consciousness and mind, not with the slave systems of his age. With this view, the implications of Hegel's work can neatly be separated from Baldwin's insistence that \"white men have for black men a reality which is far from being reciprocal.\"8</p>\n<p>Literary critics often manage to skirt the troubling implications of the closest fictional approximation of Hegel's insights, Herman Melville's classic novel of slave revolt, <i>Benito Cereno.</i> Critics have found <i>Benito Cereno</i> to be fundamentally concerned with good and evil, with civilization and savagery, with the confidence of the young American nation--with, in short, everything but African-American knowledge of whites. Not coincidentally, the writer who has done the most to restore discussions of Black genius regarding whites to discussions of the very plot of <i>Benito Cereno</i> (and to establish connections of Melville with Hegel) is the African-American historian of slavery, Sterling Stuckey. \"The slave perspective on the larger society,\" Stuckey has written in a passage suggesting one source of his insights into Melville, \"is seldom about the oppressed exclusively.\"9</p>\n<p>Notes<br>\n1.

    "synopsis": "<p><P>In this thought-provoking volume, David R. Roediger has brought together some of the most important black writers throughout history to explore the question&#58; What does it really mean to be white in America?<br><br>From folktales and slave narratives to contemporary essays, poetry, and fiction, black writers have long been among America's keenest students of white consciousness and white behavior, but until now much of this writing has been ignored.&#160;&#160;<b>Black on White</b> reverses this trend by presenting the work of more than fifty major figures, including James Baldwin, Derrick Bell, Ralph Ellison, W.E.B. Du Bois, bell hooks, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker to take a closer look at the many meanings of whiteness in our society.<br><br>Rich in irony, artistry, passion, and common sense, these reflections on what Langston Hughes called &quot;the ways of white folks&quot; illustrate how whiteness as a racial identity derives its meaning not as a biological category but as a social construct designed to uphold racial inequality. Powerful and compelling, Black on White provides a much-needed perspective that is sure to have a major impact on the study of race and race relations in America.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>These two books belong to a growing body of work that examines white identity through African American writings. Historian Roediger (Towards the Abolition of Whiteness, Norton, 1994) here collects illuminating views of \"whiteness\" from black writers ranging from such early figures as the revolutionary David Walker to contemporaries like Toni Morrison. Some of the expected sources are here, including James Baldwin's Going To Meet the Man and Richard Wright's Black Boy, but among several delightful surprises are George S. Schuyler's essay \"Our White Folks\" and Alice Walker's \"The Dummy in the Window: Joel Chandler Harris and the Invention of Uncle Remus.\" Although the anthology includes a range of perspectives, Roediger has essentially excluded \"the more reflexively antiwhite tradition represented (at times) by the nation of Islam, or by Leonard Jeffries's recent writing on whites.\" This results in some notable omissions, including Malcom X. Still, this is a valubable collection that should go a long way in helping us to understand America's troubled racial relations. Recommended for all collections. Sartwell (philosophy, Pennsylvania State Univ.) analyzes the perception of whiteness in the slave narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and Malcolm X, and contemporary rap music. He contends that whites, in seeking to establish their identity as the norm, ultimately render themselves invisible. Furthermore, white identity is typically constructed in comparison with nonwhite identities, often portraying the latter as inferior, he notes. Through the writings of African Americans, Sartwell believes whiteness can be viewed in a more objective manner. At the same time that he seeks to elucidate the texts, he grapples with his own whiteness. In the process, he has presented an engaging though disturbing investigation of the complex politics of identity. Recommended for academic libraries.Louis J.

    "excerpt": "<p class=\"null1\">An Introduction: The God Abandons Texas</p>\n<p>Being a writer and a Texan is an amusing fate, one that gets funnier as one's sense of humor darkens. In times like these it verges on the macabre. Apparently there was a time in the forties and fifties when people sort of enjoyed reading about Texas, if the reading was light enough. The state was thought to be different — another country, almost. It had Nieman-Marcus and the Alamo and a lot of rather endearing millionaires. As late as 1961 Mr. John Bainbridge of <i>The New Yorker</i> was able to do well with a book called <i>The SuperAmericans,</i> a collection of polite anecdotes about the millionaires. For Texas letters, the forties and fifties were the Golden Age; that is, J. Frank Dobie was still alive. To Texas readers he was a notch above Homer and a notch below Shakespeare, while the world outside reckoned him almost as good as Carl Sandburg. One moderately good writer was all that was expected of a place like Texas.</p>\n<p>In those days, of course, Lyndon Johnson was still only half of Rayburn and Johnson. The nation's intellectuals lost no sleep over him, and <i>MacBird</i> was undreamt of.</p>\n<p>Alas, all is changed. We aren't thought of as quaintly vulgar anymore. Some may find us <i>dangerously</i> vulgar, but the majority just find us boring. As a subject, Texas has become frankly stultifying: if it's another country, it's a country literate America hopes to hear no more about. That magisterial stream, the \"Pedernales,\" is frequently pissed in now by intellectuals who appear to hope that the products of their literary bladders will somehow eat holes in the Presidential motorboat. Having yielded Mr. Johnson, it is hardly to be expected that the state will yield anything funny in the next few years, much less anything aesthetically interesting.</p>\n*<br>\n<p>Thus the writer like myself, whose characters live in Texas, may find himself writing into a rather stiff wind. If he is ambivalent about the state as a place, the stiffness of the wind may cause him to become discouraged about it as a subject. This is particularly apt to happen if he attempts to write from Texas, as well as about it. Many Texas writers migrate, of course, and make their way to the literary capitals; there they often find their frontier manners and their experience in the boondocks so marketable socially that they have little time for reflection, and, indeed, little desire to reflect upon the place they have left. What most of them find the time for is nostalgia, a somewhat different thing.</p>\n<p>It would be a pity if the chill literary winds discourage too many people about Texas as a subject, for present-day Texas is a very rich subject, particularly for the novelist. Present-day California might be even richer, but California, whether as a subject or a place to live, is almost too taxing. There the confusion is greater, the rivalries of manners more intense: the question is whether anyone can live in California and comprehend it clearly now. Nathanael West would have a harder time with the state today than he had in 1939.</p>\n<p>Texas is almost as intense, but much less dizzying. Society here is divided, but it is not yet fragmented to a degree that would raise difficulties for the novelist. The state is at that stage of metamorphosis when it is most fertile with conflict, when rural and soil traditions are competing most desperately with urban traditions — competing for the allegiance of the young. The city will win, of course, but its victory won't be cheap — the country traditions were very strong. As the cowboys gradually leave the range and learn to accommodate themselves to the suburbs, defeats that are tragic in quality must occur and may be recorded.</p>\n*<br>\n<p>I started, indeed, to call this book <i>The Cowboy in the Suburb,</i> but chose the present title instead because I wanted a tone that was elegiac rather than sociological. Nonetheless, I think it is essentially that movement, from country to subdivision, homeplace to metropolis, that gives life in present-day Texas its passion. Or if not its passion, its strong, peculiar mixture of passions, part spurious and part genuine, part ridiculous and part tragic.</p>\n<p>However boring Texas might be to move to, it is not a boring place to be rooted. The transition that is taking place is very difficult, and the situations it creates are very intense. Living here consciously uses a great deal of one's blood; it involves one at once in a birth, a death, and a bitter love affair.</p>\n<p>From the birth I expect very little: the new Texas is probably going to be a sort of kid brother to California, with a kid brother's tendency to imitation.</p>\n<p>The death, however, moves me — the way of life that is dying had its value. Its appeal was simple, but genuine, and it called to it and is taking with it people whom one could not but love.</p>\n<p>The last, the affair of the heart and blood, is really more physical than would have seemed possible, with a land so unadorned; but the quality of one's intimacy with a place seems to depend as little on adornment as the quality of one's intimacy with a woman. One should not, perhaps, call it a <i>bitter</i> love affair — merely one that has become a little too raw, too real, too stripped of fantasy. The time may have come to part or marry, but, for myself, I put no trust in either alternative. Parting would not leave me free, nor marriage make me happy.</p>\n<p>There is a song Texas kids still sing, a song about the passing of the cowboy:</p>\n<p><i>I'm going to leave</i></p>\n<p class=\"null2\">Old Texas now,</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">They've got no use</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">For the longhorn cow.</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">They've plowed and fenced</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">My cattle range</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">And the people there</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">Are all so strange...</p>\n<p>It is a slight song, but, for the Texas writer, an inescapable subject. When I think about the passing of the cowboy, my mind inappropriately hangs on the poem of Cavafy's, from the scene in Shakespeare, from the sentence of Plutarch's: the poem in which the god abandons Antony. I like Cavafy's treatment best, with Antony at his window at night in Alexandria, bidden to drink past all deceiving while the god and his retinue file away. In Shakespeare only the guards hear the strange music that marks the god's departure, but it is still a telling moment — indeed, a telling fancy.</p>\n<p>I can believe I have heard such music myself, in Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas; by the Rio Grande and the Brazos; in the brush country and on the Staked Plains. The music of departure is now rather faint, the god almost out of hearing. The god who abandoned Antony was Hercules — what is the name of the god who now abandons Texas? Sometimes I see him as Old Man Goodnight, or as Teddy Blue, or as my Uncle Johnny — all people the reader will meet if the reader reads on — but the one thing that is sure is that he was a horseman, and a god of the country. His home was the frontier, and his mythos celebrates those masculine ideals appropriate to a frontier.</p>\n<p>Myself, I dislike frontiers, and yet the sense that my own has vanished produces in me the strongest emotion I have felt in connection with Texas, or with any place. It has embedded itself in the titles of each of my books, and just as I think I have worn the emotion out it seizes me again, usually at some unlikely moment. I see my son, age five, riding a mechanical horse in front of the laundromat on Sunday morning, and the sight calls up my Uncle Johnny, when he was age five, sitting on top of the McMurtry barn watching the last trail herd go by. It is indeed a complex distance from those traildrivers who made my father and my uncles determined to be cowboys to the mechanical horse that helps convince my son that he is a cowboy, as he takes a vertical ride in front of a laundromat.</p>\n<p>That is the distance I hope to cover in this book. It may, like my other books, be a form of parting, a wave of the hand at Old Man Goodnight, Teddy Blue, Uncle Johnny and all they stood for.</p>\n*<br>\n<p>It is also, on a baser level, a literary gambit. It has clearly become necessary to write discursively of Texas if one is to be heard at all beyond one's city limits. The South, fortunately for its writers, has always been dark and bloody ground, but Texas is only scenery, and poor scenery at that. Even so, Mr. Faulkner had to write about a girl being raped with a corncob before he gained more than a semblance of a readership, and most of that soon deserted him. Today the fields of fiction are littered with raped bodies — try the corncob route and readers will yawn in your face.</p>\n<p>As a regionalist, and a regionalist from an unpopular region, I find the problem of how to get heard rather a fascinating one. I haven't found it especially depressing, but then I wouldn't have gone in for writing if I hadn't liked talking to myself. I quite recognize that there have always been literary capitals and literary provinces, and that those who choose for whatever reason to abide in the provinces need not expect a modish recognition. Recently, of course, the picture has become much brighter. The Texas writer who really wants to get famous has only to work up his autobiography in such a way that it will (1) explain the assassination and (2) make it possible for President Johnson to be impeached. If he can do that, his name is made. <i>The New York Review of Books</i> will beat a path to his door, particularly if his door happens to be somewhere in Manhattan. Should his door be in Anarene, Texas, they will probably rely on the mails, but in any event he can put obscurity behind him. If he ever gets to New York he may even meet Susan Sontag.</p>\n<p>I don't understand the assassination and I doubt that I can do anything about the President. My chances of meeting Miss Sontag are accordingly pretty slim and I might as well forget about it and go on and write a book about the place where my characters live.</p>\n<p>I have a feeling I had better do it now, before the emotion I feel at the thought of the god becomes only the memory of an emotion. That god is riding fast away, and will soon be out of sight and out of hearing.</p>\n<p>Copyright © 1968 by Larry McMurtry</p>\n<p> Copyright renewed © 1996 by Larry McMurtry</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Gym class, group showers, zits, band practice, drama club, birth of pubic hair, pranks, secrets, spin-the-bottle, voice changes, bullies, sissies, friendship, enemyship -- what's not to love about turning 13? For a gay child, it may be traumatic, but it also carries a richness of observed detail of small but important moments, turning points of sorts. Adolescence is a watermark for pain and change; the anthology <i>Queer 13</i> contains 25 remembrances of the era of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, charged with the sparks that only the very young can give off.</p><h3>Hank Stuever</h3><p>\"When casting about for survival tales of the seventh grade, Clifford Chase, who edited this book of essays, found that most gay writers had suppressed it, like time they'd spent in a cultural junior-high version of Dachau: utter oppression, grueling days, anxious and terrifying nights. They'd simply blocked it out. Seventh grade wasn't too fun for anyone, but it seems to be a particular watershed event for these wordy gays and lesbians, who have risen to the assignment and reconjured that particular year with pubescent horror: the longing, the armpit hair, the confusion, the shame, the teasing -- it's all here. Thankfully, as the sage Judy Blume always assured us, it's only seventh grade, and most everyone survives it. Even gay kids. Seen from these 25 collected pieces -- many of them quite clever memoirs; some of them merely more overwrought gunk from the para-memoirist craze -- seventh grade is quite a hurdle, but also a magic place.\"</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P><b>Selected and introduced by acclaimed novelist and poet Paul Beatty, <i>Hokum</i> is a liberating, eccentric, savagely comic collection of the funniest writing by black Americans. </b><P>This book is less a comprehensive collection of African-American humor than a mix-tape narrative dubbed by a trusted friend&#151;a sampler of underground classics, rare grooves, and timeless summer jams, poetry and prose juxtaposed with the blues, hip-hop, political speeches, and the world's funniest radio sermon. The subtle musings of Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas, and Harryette Mullen are bracketed by the profane and often loud ruminations of Langston Hughes, Darius James, Wanda Coleman, Tish Benson, Steve Cannon, and Hattie Gossett. Some of the funniest writers don't write, so included are selections from well-known yet unpublished wits Lightnin' Hopkins, Mike Tyson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Selections also come from public figures and authors whose humor, although incisive and profound, is often overlooked&#58; Malcolm X, Suzan-Lori Parks, Zora Neale Hurston, Sojourner Truth, and W.E.B. Dubois. Groundbreaking, fierce, and hilarious, this is a necessary anthology for any fan or student of American writing, with a huge range and a smart, political grasp of the uses of humor.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Acclaimed novelist Beatty (Tuff; White Boy Shuffle) models this controversial anthology on a \"mix-tape narrative dubbed by a trusted... friend.\" Like a mix-tape, the collection is intensely personal: its encompassing feature is the bright, plaintive, scathingly ironic voice that introduces the volume and its various sections. Beatty, who \"was the butt of the first joke [he'd] ever heard,\" mines two centuries of African-American culture for speeches, poems, fiction, comics and screenplays that mirror his own glass-cutting wit and satisfy, in places, his taste for \"unintentional comedy.\" (To wit, \"The Wit and Wisdom of Mike Tyson.\") Apart from usual suspects like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, a Norton anthology this is not. Selections from Fran Ross and Prophet Omega dizzy readers in their logical funhouses. Hattie Gossett's \"80s Version of the Dozens\" leads them through sewer pipes of lyrical imagination. The volume's general tenor is wild, winking and explosive. As such, it picks up where Chappelle's Show left off-gouging the government, lampooning cultures black and white, leaving no sacred cow unslaughtered. Even the smiling watermelon on the book's front cover has been retained despite sniffs by national media outlets. \"This is black humor,\" Beatty writes, \"and I don't mean African-American black.\" Indeed, at times-as when John Farris's schoolchildren blithely gun down pedestrians-you may need night-vision goggles to find the joke.

    "overview": "<p><b>Voices in Our Blood</b> is a literary anthology of the most important and artful interpretations of the civil rights movement, past and present. It showcases what forty of the nation's best writers — including Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Alice Walker, Robert Penn Warren, Eudora Welty, and Richard Wright — had to say about the central domestic drama of the American Century.</p>\n<p>Editor Jon Meacham has chosen pieces by journalists, novelists, historians, and artists, bringing together a wide range of black and white perspectives and experiences. The result is an unprecedented and powerful portrait of the movement's spirit and struggle, told through voices that resonate with passion and strength.</p>\n<p>Maya Angelou takes us on a poignant journey back to her childhood in the Arkansas of the 1930s. On the front page of <i>The New York Times</i>, James Reston marks the movement's apex as he describes what it was like to watch Martin Luther King, Jr., deliver his heralded \"I Have a Dream\" speech in real time. Alice Walker takes up the movement's progress a decade later in her article <i>\"Choosing to Stay at Home: Ten Years After the March on Washington.\"</i> And John Lewis chronicles the unimaginable courage of the ordinary African Americans who challenged the prevailing order, paid for it in blood and tears, and justly triumphed.</p>\n<p><b>Voices in Our Blood</b> is a compelling look at the movement as it actually happened, from the days leading up to World War II to the anxieties and ambiguities of this new century.

    "excerpt": "<p><b>Inheritors of Slavery: Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States, 1941</b><br>\n<i>Richard Wright</i></p>\n<p>The word \"Negro,\" the term by which, orally or in print, we black folk in the United States are usually designated, is not really a name at all nor a description, but a psychological island whose objective form is the most unanimous fiat in all American history; a fiat buttressed by popular and national tradition, and written down in many state and city statutes; a fiat which artificially and arbitrarily defines, regulates, and limits in scope of meaning the vital contours of our lives, and the lives of our children and our children's children.</p>\n<p>This island, within whose confines we live, is anchored in the feelings of millions of people, and is situated in the midst of the sea of white faces we meet each day; and, by and large, as three hundred years of time has borne our nation into the twentieth century, its rocky boundaries have remained unyielding to the waves of our hope that dash against it.<br>\nThe steep cliffs of this island are manifest, on the whole, in the conduct of whites toward us hour by hour, a conduct which tells us that we possess no rights commanding respect, that we have no claim to pursue happiness in our own fashion, that our progress toward civilization constitutes an insult, that our behavior must be kept firmly within an orbit branded as inferior, that we must be compelled to labor at the behest of others, that as a group we are owned by the whites, and that manliness on our part warrants instant reprisal.</p>\n<p>Three hundred years are a long time for millions of folk like us to be held in such subjection, so long a time that perhaps scores of years will have to pass before we shall be able to express what this slavery has done to us, for our personalities are still numb from its long shocks; and, as the numbness leaves our souls, we shall yet have to feel and give utterance to the full pain we shall inherit.</p>\n<p>More than one-half of us black folk in the United States are tillers of the soil, and three-fourths of those of us who till the soil are sharecroppers and day laborers. The land we till is beautiful, with red and black and brown clay, with fresh and hungry smells, with pine trees and palm trees, with rolling hills and swampy delta—an unbelievably fertile land, bounded on the north by the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico, on the west by the Mississippi River, and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p>Our southern springs are filled with quiet noises and scenes of growth. Apple buds laugh into blossom. Honeysuckles creep up the sides of houses. Sunflowers nod in the hot fields. From mossy tree to mossy tree—oak, elm, willow, aspen, sycamore, dogwood, cedar, walnut, ash, and hickory–bright green leaves jut from a million branches to form an awning that tries to shield and shade the earth. Blue and pink kites of small boys sail in the windy air.</p>\n<p>In summer the magnolia trees fill the countryside with sweet scent for long miles. Days are slumberous, and the skies are high and thronged with clouds that ride fast. At midday the sun blazes and bleaches the soil. Butterflies flit through the heat; wasps sing their sharp, straight lines; birds fluff and flounce, piping in querulous joy. Nights are covered with canopies sometimes blue and sometimes black, canopies that sag low with ripe and nervous stars. The throaty boast of frogs momentarily drowns out the call and counter-call of crickets.</p>\n<p>In autumn the land is afire with color. Red and brown leaves lift and flutter dryly, becoming entangled in the stiff grass and cornstalks. Cotton is picked and ginned; cane is crushed and its juice is simmered down into molasses; yams are grubbed out of the clay; hogs are slaughtered and cured in lingering smoke; corn is husked and ground into meal. At twilight the sky is full of wild geese winging ever southward, and bats jerk through the air. At night the winds blow free.</p>\n<p>In winter the forests resound with the bite of steel axes eating into tall trees as men gather wood for the leaden days of cold. The guns of hunters snap and crack. Long days of rain come, and our swollen creeks rush to join a hundred rivers that wash across the land and make great harbors where they feed the gulf or the sea. Occasionally the rivers leap their banks and leave new thick layers of silt to enrich the earth, and then the look of the land is garish, bleak, suffused with a first-day stillness, strangeness, and awe.</p>\n<p>But whether in spring or summer or autumn or winter, time slips past us remorselessly, and it is hard to tell of the iron that lies beneath the surface of our quiet, dull days. To paint the picture of how we live on the tobacco, cane, rice, and cotton plantations is to compete with mighty artists: the movies, the radio, the newspapers, the magazines, and even the Church. They have painted one picture: charming, idyllic, romantic; but we live another: full of the fear of the Lords of the Land, bowing and grinning when we meet white faces, toiling from sun to sun, living in unpainted wooden shacks that sit casually and insecurely upon the red clay.</p>\n<p>In the main we are different from other folk in that, when an impulse moves us, when we are caught in the throes of inspiration, when we are moved to better our lot, we do not ask ourselves: \"Can we do it?\" but: \"Will they let us do it?\" Before we black folk can move, we must first look into the white man's mind to see what is there, to see what he is thinking, and the white man’s mind is a mind that is always changing.</p>\n<p>In general there are three classes of men above us: the Lords of the Land—operators of the plantations; the Bosses of the Buildings—the owners of industry; and the vast numbers of poor white workers—our immediate competitors in the daily struggle for bread. The Lords of the Land hold sway over the plantations and over us; the Bosses of the Buildings lend money and issue orders to the Lords of the Land. The Bosses of the Buildings feed upon the Lords of the Land, and the Lords of the Land feed upon the 5,000,000 landless poor whites and upon us, throwing to the poor whites the scant solace of filching from us 4,000,000 landless blacks what the poor whites themselves are cheated of in this elaborate game.</p>\n<p>Back of this tangled process is a long history. When the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, there were some 4,000,000 of us black folk stranded and bewildered upon the land which we had tilled under compulsion for two and a half centuries. Sundered suddenly from the only relationship with Western civilization we had been allowed to form since our captivity, our personalities blighted by two hundred and fifty years of servitude, and eager to hold our wives and husbands and children together in family units, some of us turned back to the same Lords of the Land who had held us as slaves and begged for work, resorted to their advice; and there began for us a new kind of bondage: sharecropping.</p>\n<p>Glad to be free, some of us drifted and gave way to every vagary of impulse that swept through us, being held in the line of life only by the necessity to work and eat. Confined for centuries to the life of the cotton field, many of us possessed no feelings of family, home, community, race, church, or progress. We could scarcely believe that we were free, and our restlessness and incessant mobility were our naïve way of testing that freedom. Just as a kitten stretches and yawns after a long sleep, so thousands of us tramped from place to place for the sheer sake of moving, looking, wondering, landless upon the land. Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and West Virginia became the home states of us freed blacks.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4><font face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"-1\"><b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b></font><br>\nHere is the contemporaneous record of the civil rights movement, profound and historic events captured by great writers as they happened. <i>Voices in Our Blood,</i> the first anthology of its kind, collects standout essays and reportage by Ralph Ellison, David Halberstam, Maya Angelou, Robert Penn Warren, Richard Wright, and many others. Several decades later, the movement's success may seem preordained; but these compelling pieces attest to just how volatile the debate was and how precarious the balance -- and how important the issues remain. \n<p>In <i>Voices in Our Blood,</i> <i>Newsweek</i> managing editor John Meacham accurately samples the complexity of the civil rights movement's underlying themes, assembling an impressive, eclectic array of commentary, journalism, and interviews. Here is a running narrative of America's deep midcentury moral crisis, as recorded by the era's finest writers. In his stirring introduction, Meacham quotes Richard Wright's prophetic 1945 statement regarding the abolition of legalized segregation: \"If this country can't find its way to a human path, if it can't inform conduct with a deep sense of life, then all of us, black as well as white, are going down the same drain.\"</p>\n<p>Jim Crow, while a reality for black Americans, was peripheral to post-WWII white Americans, who were more intent on pursuing prosperity than tackling racial discrimination and answering the \"Negro Question.\" Many black and white contemporary thinkers, though, pushed the nation's social conscience, and their brilliantly written reportage and commentary fills <i>Voices in Our Blood.</i> Meacham's anthology illuminates the human lives at risk, as well as the broader cultural and philosophical aspects of the struggle.</p>\n<p>The collection is both a literary delight and a documentation of racism's pervading poisons. Willie Morris's <a href=\"http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?sLinkPrefix&amp;isbn=0375724605\"><i>North Toward Home</i></a> (1967) peers behind a small Mississippi town's façade of normality, exposing the legalized apartheid and soul-warping prejudice that define life and its parameters. For Maya Angelou, in passages excerpted from 1970's <a href=\"http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?sLinkPrefix&amp;isbn=055338001X\"><i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i></a>, poverty and racism become almost living entities in her Arkansas childhood. Meanwhile, James Baldwin eloquently and poetically describes the bitter toll exacted by prejudice and denied opportunity on a black Harlemite in <a href=\"http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?sLinkPrefix&amp;isbn=0807064319\"><i>Notes of a Native Son</i></a>. A stellar (surprise) inclusion is Rebecca West's 1947 article \"Opera in Greenville,\" detailing the racial killing of a black man in South Carolina and its terrifying aftermath.</p>\n<p>In these and many other selections, Meacham ably captures the civil rights movement in motion, balanced between hope and despair. And ever for the oppressor, the ultimate price of inequality is high. As novelist William Faulkner poignantly asks (of his fellow white southerners), \"Why didn't someone tell us this before? Tell us this in time?\" <i>(Robert Fleming)</i></p>\n<p><i>Robert Fleming is the author of many books, most recently</i> The African-American Writer's Handbook: How to Get in Print and Stay in Print. <i>He is also a contributor to</i> Brown Sugar: A Collection of Erotic Black Fiction. <i>Mr. Fleming lives in New York City</i></p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Black Issues Book Review</h4>Without question, the civil rights movement was one of the most significant periods in American history. Meacham’s new book, which pays homage to the period, is a compilation of work spotlighting some of the nation’s most powerful and vociferous writers and journalists.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                                            </h4>To \"give a flavor of what life was like\" as the Civil Rights movement played itself out, Meacham, the managing editor of Newsweek, has assembled \"a highly personal anthology\" of \"the country's best writing on the midcentury crisis.\" Extending far beyond the decade between Rosa Parks's bold act of resistance to the proprieties of segregation in 1955 and the landmark civil rights bills of 1965, Meacham includes some unexpected works written in the heat of the moment: Tom Wolfe's \"wicked portrait of the liberal elite's fascination with the Black Panthers,\" Alex Haley's Playboy interview with Malcolm X and Howell Raines's memoir of his family's complex relationship with their black housekeeper. The pieces range broadly, from \"the fissures between the young and the old within the black community\" in the late 1950s (embodied in the relationship between Stokely Carmichael and John Kaspar), to the \"cornucopia of discontent\" afflicting \"blacks in the 1980s and 1990s\" as rendered by Ellis Cose. Mixing the work of artists and journalists, including Rebecca West, Taylor Branch, William Styron, Eudora Welty, Stanley Crouch, Elizabeth Hardwick, Alice Walker, Hodding Carter and Richard Wright, this compilation is a useful resource for tracking the daily realities of civil rights struggles. Meacham captures the movement's \"complications behind the public spectacle\" with immediacy, driving home the point that black and white citizens of the U.S. remain \"connected by a common heritage, yet hopelessly divided by skin color.\" (Jan.) Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>KLIATT</h4>It's no exaggeration to say \"America's best\" in the subtitle: Robert Penn Warren, David Halberstam, Maya Angelou, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, Willie Morris, William Styron, Eudora Welty, William Faulkner, Alice Walker, Walker Percy—and more! My hesitation is for YA readers because this is a large collection (561 pages) and the print is not large by any means. Nevertheless, students could read portions, especially since the book is divided into four chronological blocks. A student could focus on any of the periods: just before the movement, as it starts, as it culminates, and as it ebbs. The editing is momentous. What to choose from so much literature? Some pieces are articles from such icons as The New Yorker and The Atlantic Monthly. Most are excerpts taken from larger works: for instance, from Parting the Waters, the prize-winning biography of MLK by Taylor Branch, is a description of King speaking about \"the bus situation in Montgomery\" to people gathered in a church after Rosa Parks has been arrested. An excerpt from Congressman John Louis's autobiography Walking with the Wind is included—\"Bloody Sunday\" about the march on Selma. Even though some of the writers are best known for their fiction (William Faulkner, Eudora Welty), their work chosen for this collection is nonfiction. Each selection is remarkable in its own way, and the anthology as a whole is a formidable reading project. KLIATT Codes: SA*—Exceptional book, recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2001, Random House, 561p. index., <br>\n— Claire Rosser\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Juan Williams</h4>Here are stories and news reports about real people exposing real fear, racial prejudice, as well as real bravery and honesty, as they deal with racial situations...This is the essence of race raltions, and it is also the true heart of this valuable collection of writings.<br>\n—<i>Washington Monthly</i>\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "A century ago, in a genteel neighborhood of Montgomery, Alabama, a child was born who would eventually embody the freewheeling spirit of the 1920s flapper. Lavish and impulsive, Zelda Fitzgerald offered an alluring mix of privilege and melodrama to complement her young novelist husband, E Scott Fitzgerald. The couple stormed through the New York and Paris party circuits, cutting a lasting image of beauty and flamboyance. He produced great works of literature; she wrote fiction and essays, painted, and dreamed of being a dancer. Before she turned thirty, however, Zelda's life would take an abrupt turn as she experienced the first of several mental breakdowns. To those who knew her, the great American flapper had slipped behind a veil of madness. \n<p>Like Zelda Fitzgerald, generations of other gifted, unconventional, and tormented women have seen their lives eclipsed by mental illness. They have suffered from depression, schizophrenia, manic depression, and other psychological disorders. Their life ambitions have been derailed by illnesses that bring sadness, delusions, and fears leaving one, as Zelda once described herself, \"heart-broken, grief-stricken, spiritually sick.\"</p>\n<p>Other talented, outlandish women have been labeled \"mad\" simply for defying societal norms. They are the ones, in the not too distant past, who were considered lunatics for rejecting their socially imposed roles as homemakers. They are the ones who were dragged to institutions for disagreeing with their husbands about religion. They are the ones, like Ann Hopkins, the seventeenth-century politician's wife, who, according to one observer, became insane after \"giving herself wholly to reading and writing.\"</p>\n<p>So what is \"madness\"? When is it mental illness? Or when is it the circumstances of a woman's life driving her \"out of her mind\"? These are the fundamental questions that first inspired this anthology. In looking for answers, my instincts guided me to literature and history. Ever since I first read about Zelda Fitzgerald some twenty years ago, her life has felt unresolved to me, like a stranded traveler in the back of my mind. Was she destined to be mentally ill, or was she overshadowed by her marriage, driven mad by her unfulfilled aspirations?</p>\n<p>My purpose in creating this anthology was twofold: to compile selections from the writings of Zelda Fitzgerald and other twentieth century women, such as Sylvia Plath, Susanna Kaysen, Kate Millett, and Lauren Slater, who have so deftly rendered their psychological turmoil in American literature; and to track down the other troubled, often misunderstood women whose forgotten writings on madness were buried, I suspected, somewhere on library shelves or confined to aging reels of microfilm.</p>\n<p>At Princeton University, I read volumes of Zelda's manuscripts and letters, most of them composed in her brash, big-looped handwriting. While reviewing her lifetime of correspondence, I happened upon unpublished letters written during one of her many hospitalizations. Four of those letters are published here for the first time.</p>\n<p>At other libraries, I began to unearth historical selections-many of them out of print-including an 1896 essay titled \"Confessions of a Nervous Woman\"; an 1887 expose describing how the famed journalist Elizabeth Cochrane, better known as Nellie Bly, feigned insanity to investigate a mental institution; and an 1873 account by Elizabeth Parsons Ware Packard, whose husband had her committed after she publicly challenged his beliefs. For historical context, I turned to the reportage of another Victorian stalwart, the social reformer Dorothea Dix, who, though she was not mad, single-handedly recounted the abuse of mentally ill women in several states.</p>\n<p>During my searches, I came across other harrowing pieces of history. There were tales from the Middle Ages, detailing how those suffering from mental illness were considered lepers and sent away to remote countrysides or warehoused on a \"Ship of Fools.\" Other stories spoke of public whippings and barred windows that allowed passers-by to observe mad men and women shackled by chains. To represent this period, I have included an excerpt from The Book of Margery Kempe, which tells of the violent mental collapse of a medieval mystic.</p>\n<p>Digging through old books and journals also confirmed the uniqueness of women's experiences in the world of mental illness. The notion of \"hysteria,\" which some people once linked to witchcraft, had overtaken the public consciousness by the nineteenth century. With that came a preoccupation with the female reproductive system-the uterus, in particular, the Greek name for which gives us the word \"hysteria\"-which dictated many of the medical profession's misguided attempts to cure this broad, undefinable category of mental conditions. In the medical literature of the late 1800s, one can easily find references to gynecological procedures, such as removal of the ovaries or even cauterization of the clitoris, which doctors performed on their hysterical patients. Perhaps no other piece of writing embodies this era of oppression and medical injustice better than Charlotte Perkins Gilman's classic short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper,\" which also is included in the collection.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I read a great deal about the doctors who hoped to cure the so-called menace of hysteria. Yet I was struck by the icy tone of one in particular, Dr. Edward C. Mann, who in the 1880s wrote about hysteria in a medical journal: \"The mental condition of a woman with hysteria is somewhat peculiar,\" he explained. \"The patient, when the hysterical feelings come upon her, does not feel disposed to make the slightest effort to resist them, and yields to her emotions, whatever they may be. She will laugh or cry on the slightest provocation, and is very nervous and excitable. She cares nothing for her duties and seemingly takes pleasure in exaggerating all her slight discomforts and annoyances, and by her suspicious exacting and unreasonable behavior makes life generally uncomfortable to those about her.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps no one professed to know more about unraveling mental chaos, though, than the Viennese neurologist who staked claim to the patient's unexplored dreams and fertile unconscious. Building from his studies of hysteria, Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis at the turn of the century as a means of understanding neuroses. After implicating the lasting psychological impact of childhood traumas, he fathered the era of \"talk therapy,\" which many authors have mined for its rich drama.</p>\n<p>While reading Sylvia Plath's devastating account of a doctor-patient therapeutic relationship in The Bell&nbsp;&nbsp;Jar, Dr. Mann's coarse statements about hysteria and Dr. Freud's theories of mental suffering seem to echo behind her prose. I had imagined a kind, ugly, intuitive man looking up and saying 'Ah!' in an encouraging way, as if he could see something I couldn't, and then I would find words to tell him how I was so scared, as if I were being stuffed farther and farther into a black, airless sack with no way out,\" wrote Plath. \"But Doctor Gordon wasn't like that at all. He was young and good-looking, and I could see right away he was conceited.... The whole time I was talking, Doctor Gordon bent his head as if he were praying, and the only noise apart from the dull, flat voice was the tap, tap, tap of Doctor Gordon's pencil at the same point on the green blotter, like a stalled walking stick.\"</p>\n<p>Not long after patients were encouraged to talk about their mental distress, the medical establishment adopted more extreme measures, such as electroshock therapy (EST), insulin therapy, and the lobotomy. For women whose mental illnesses defied medical doctrine, doctors increasingly prescribed massive surges of electrical currents delivered to the brain,-Iarge doses of insulin to induce convulsions, or, for seemingly hopeless cases, a surgical operation to sever nerve pathways in the frontal lobes of the cerebrum. Mary Jane Ward's popular novel The Snake Pit and New Zealand writer Janet Frame's Faces in the Water are excerpted in this collection to portray the ominous world of EST during its early years of use.</p>\n<p>The venue of such therapy was typically the dreaded asylum, where generations of women have gained ' or lost their sanity, depending on one's viewpoint. At the urging of doctors, family members delivered the mentally ill to these austere institutions with the intention of rejuvenating the mind and spirits of those who could not find solace in their homes. Sadly, many asylums quickly gained a stronger reputation for the horror of their locked wards and punishing regimens than for the effectiveness of their institutional care. Like Zelda Fitzgerald's letters, The Loony-Bin Trip by Kate Millett captures the monotony and crushing isolation of day-to-day existence in a mental institution.</p>\n<p>By the time I closed in on the I latter part of the twentieth century, it was clear that mental illness had become inextricably tied to a vast array of prescription drugs. While some of these drugs are still delivered forcibly to women in institutions, others, such as Valium, Xanax, Paxil, and Prozac, to name just a few, are consumed eagerly by legions of devotees. To address some of the resulting philosophical questions about the influence of chemicals on one's true personality, the essays \"Black Swans\" by Lauren Slater and \"Thorazine Shuffle\" by the film-maker Allie Light have been included in the collection.</p>\n<p>Other questions-big, eternal ones about the meaning of insanity-appear as themes in many of the works excerpted here, such as the anonymously written Autobiograpby of a Schizophrenic Girl and Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen. In her memoir, Kaysen describes the onset of madness: \"Experience is thick. Perceptions are thickened and dulled. Time is slow, dripping slowly through the clogged filter of thickened perception. The body temperature is low. The pulse is sluggish. The immune system is half-asleep. The organism is torpid and brackish. Even the reflexes are diminished, as if the lower leg couldn't be bothered to jerk itself out of its stupor when the knee is tapped.\"</p>\n<p>The issue of family also asserts itself time and time again in these writings. In contemporary stories and histories alike, relatives existed as diminished, shattered figures beside the raging force of mania, despair, or paranoia. What are the experiences of those who cannot escape the heat of mental illness? What is the psychological toll of caring for someone who is emotionally troubled? The Woman Warrior by Maxine Hong Kingston and \"Isolation\" by Martha Ellen Hughes search for answers to these questions while also penetrating some of the family myths that shroud madness in so many cultures. In other excerpts, such as those from Signe Hammer's By Her Own Hand and Linda Gray Sexton's Searching for Mercy Street, the mother-daughter bond, and its attendant conflicts, is seen through the prism of suicide.</p>\n<p>In addition to the distinct psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, that are represented in the anthology, I felt that it was important to present a few selections about depression, the mental illness that affects nearly twice as many women as men. In the collection, excerpts from The Beast by Tracy Thompson and Willow Weep for Me by Meri Nana-Ama Danquah express the numbing sorrow and emptiness of the disorder that both writers and clinicians refer to as the \"common cold\" of mental illness. In her memoir, Danquah wrote: \"Depression offers layers, textures, noises. At times depression is as flimsy as a feather, barely penetrating the surface of my life, hovering like a slight halo of pessimism. Other times it comes on gradually like a common cold or a storm, each day presenting new signals and symptoms until finally I am drowning in it. Most times, in its most superficial and seductive sense, it is rich and enticing. A field of velvet waiting to embrace me. It is loud and dizzying, inviting the tenors and screeching sopranos of thoughts, unrelenting sadness, and the sense of impending doom.\"</p>\n<p>Though many of the writers whose work is included here have been widely read, their nonfictional and fictional accounts of mental illness have not been collected in a single volume. The scholar Troy Porter has written extensively about the history of madness in a number of books, including The Greatest Benefit to Mankind and A Social History of Madness. The institutionalization of women has been documented in Dr. Jeffrey L. Geller and psychologist Maxine Harris's wonderful collection Women of the Asylum. And feminist psychologist Phyllis Chesler has eloquently indicted the oppressive clinical tradition that has prevailed for so many years in her classic, Madness and Women. Yet the general topic of madness in women has not been addressed in a literary and historical collection, only in individual novels, essays, memoirs, and articles. With this anthology, I hope to create a collective voice that will speak for the mentally ill women who have so frequently been cast aside for their \"otherness.\"</p>\n<p>In researching this book, I also encountered a number of delightful women whose circumstances surrounding their madness were more remarkable than their writings. I have not included their work in the collection but offer two such remarkable stories here:</p>\n<p>In 1890, a brazen 41-year-old known as Andrew M. Sheffield, who cursed and defied the conventions of feminine propriety, was committed to an Alabama mental asylum. An addict and an alleged arsonist who had an affair with a man who supplied her with drugs, she corresponded with a succession of governors in hopes of being moved to a prison. For thirty years, she was unsuccessful in her efforts and eventually died at the hospital. Her correspondence is published in The Letters of a Victorian Madwoman, edited by John S. Hughes.</p>\n<p>Another Victorian eccentric was an Englishwoman named Georgina Weldon, whose husband tried to have her committed after learning that she believed her dead mother had been reincarnated as a pet rabbit, a claim that these days might win her a lucrative book contract and a place on the bestseller lists. However, by locking herself in the house and disguising herself as a nun so she could safely leave the premises, Weldon escaped from an alienist who had been instructed to escort her to an asylum. Her experiences eventually played a part in the reform of insanity laws, and in 1878 she published The History of my Orphanage or the Outpourings of an Alleged Lunatic.</p>\n<p>In 1999, well over a century after Weldon eluded the asylum, the White House sponsored its first-ever conference on mental health. At that gathering, Tipper Gore referred to mental illness as the \"last great stigma of the twentieth century.\" Though it is debatable how far society has advanced in its treatment of those who, seemingly at random, have been besieged by madness, it is clear that there is an important body of literature that can reveal to others the largely private world of emotional suffering. The writers whose works are collected in this anthology not only represent creative, romanticized women, like Zelda Fitzgerald, Sylvia Plath, and so many others, but also, in a sense, the silent, anonymous ones who, for generations, have existed behind harsh, impersonal statistics of mental illness. It is my hope that, with this book, their stories will also be told.</p>\n<p class=\"null1\">From the Hardcover edition.</p>",
    "synopsis": "<p><P><i>Out of Her Mind</i>, edited by Rebecca Shannonhouse, captures the best literature by and about women struggling with madness. A remarkable chronicle of gifted and unconventional women who have spun their inner turmoil into literary gold, the collection features classic short stories, breathtaking literary excerpts, key historical writings, and previously unpublished letters by Zelda Fitzgerald.<P>Shannonhouse&#8217;s recent anthology, <i>Under the Influence&#58; The Literature of Addiction</i>, is also available as a Modern Library Paperback Original.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This somewhat uneven collection by freelance writer Shannonhouse focuses not on the experience of mental illness but rather on descriptions of those experiences (both first-and secondhand) written by women, making the subject matter fairly unique. The time span of the 21 brief selections is impressive (1436-1999); however, almost two-thirds of the writings are from the last half of the 20th century. The wide range of work includes arresting first-person descriptions of mental illness and the equally riveting 1843 testimony of Dorothea Dix on the conditions of Massaschusetts insane assylums. Unfortunately, this collection also includes material such as four rather benign letters by Zelda Fitzgerald (published here for the first time) in which she describes \"picnic suppers' and \"idyllic days\" spent at Highland Hospital. Although sufficient for casual reading, a topic this intriguing deserves more thorough treatment. Recommend for larger public and academic collections.-Angela M. Weiler, SUNY Libs., Morrisville</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>The bestselling author of The Road from Coorain presents an extraordinarily powerful anthology of the autobiographical writings of 25 women, literary predecessors and contemporaries that include Jane Addams, Zora Neale Hurst, Harriet Jacobs, Ellen Glasgow, Maya Angelou, Sara Josephine Baker, Margaret Mead, Gloria Steinem, and Maxine Hong Kingston.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The autobiographies in this collection are by women of extraordinary achievement--some well known, some neglected through the generations--who overcame daunting obstacles to pursue their individual destinies in an often hostile, changing America. The narratives, chosen and edited by historian Conway, a former president of Smith College, are grouped into the areas of freedom-fighting, science, arts and letters, and social reform. Among the women relaying their encounters with discrimination are Marian Anderson, preeminent black contralto, who was celebrated in Europe but barred from appearing at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and Margaret Mead, the renowned anthropologist, who refused a ``safe'' field assignment and forged her own way in Samoa. Many, like writer Zora Neale Hurston, emerged from broken or impoverished families to pursue an education and find a way to support themselves and their families. The strong, clear voices of the trailblazers found in this exemplary anthology reveal a sheer delight in excellence, adventure, and intellectual challenge.

    "overview": "<i>Asian American Studies Now</i> truly represents the enormous changes occurring in Asian American communities and the world, changes that require a reconsideration of how the interdisciplinary field of Asian American studies is defined and taught. This comprehensive anthology, arranged in four parts and featuring a stellar group of contributors, summarizes and defines the current shape of this rapidly changing field, addressing topics such as transnationalism, U.S. imperialism, multiracial identity, racism, immigration, citizenship, social justice, and pedagogy.\n<p>Jean Yu-wen Shen Wu and Thomas C. Chen have selected essays for the significance of their contribution to the field and their clarity, brevity, and accessibility to readers with little to no prior knowledge of Asian American studies. Featuring both reprints of seminal articles and groundbreaking texts, as well as bold new scholarship, <i>Asian American Studies Now</i> addresses the new circumstances, new communities, and new concerns that are reconstituting Asian America.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Something about the South has inspired the imaginations of an extraordinary number of America’s best storytellers—and greatest writers. That quality may be a rich, unequivocal sense of place, a living connection with the past, or the contradictions and passions that endow this region with awesome beauty and equally awesome tragedy. The stories in this superb collection of modern Southern writing are about childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood—in other words, about growing up in the South. Flannery O’Connor’s “Everything That Rises Must Converge,” set in a South that remains segregated even after segregation is declared illegal, is the story of a white college student who chastises his mother for her prejudice against blacks. But black, white, aristocrat, or sharecropper, each of these 23 authors is unmistakably Southern—and their writing is indisputably wonderful.</p>",

Johnson - Choice</h3><p>Trodd organizes this excellent anthology around 11 reform movements, most based on race, class, or gender (e.g., the American Revolution, abolition, women's suffrage, gay rights). Collecting the work of both established writers and new voices, the book comprises some hundred pieces (1-3 pages each)&#58; prose excerpts, political documents, poems, photographs, film briefs, essays, fiction, narratives, and orations...This excellent book can serve as a textbook as well as a resource on social change and the literature thereof. Indeed, the persuasiveness of the collection raises the question not only of whether protest literature is a genre of its own, but also of whether it is the most American literary form.</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Choice</h4><p>Trodd organizes this excellent anthology around 11 reform movements, most based on race, class, or gender (e.g., the American Revolution, abolition, women's suffrage, gay rights). Collecting the work of both established writers and new voices, the book comprises some hundred pieces (1–3 pages each): prose excerpts, political documents, poems, photographs, film briefs, essays, fiction, narratives, and orations… This excellent book can serve as a textbook as well as a resource on social change and the literature thereof. Indeed, the persuasiveness of the collection raises the question not only of whether protest literature is a genre of its own, but also of whether it is the most American literary form.<br>\n— L. L. Johnson</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Syracuse New Times</h4><p>The recently published treasure <i>American Protest Literature</i>, edited by Zoe Trodd…belongs on our bookshelves for two types of enjoyment. For starters, it is an invaluable reference, the first anthology to collect and examine American literature 'that holds the nation to its highest ideals, castigating it when it falls short and pointing the way to a better collective future.' It is also a great pleasure to read the 500-plus pages… May the daily newspaper and the nightly news glow with new perspective. Read this book.<br>\n— Karen DeCrow</p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>In this time of warrantless wiretaps and imprisonment without trial, these two anthologies remind us how hard previous generations of Americans fought to preserve and broaden our civil and human rights. Dissent is the larger and broader of the two. Young (history, Temple Univ.) organizes his book chronologically, with introductions to each of nine broad periods from pre-Revolutionary War to contemporary times (Cindy Sheehan against the war in Iraq in 2005) and briefer introductions for each author. Early protests of religious persecution by Puritans in the 17th century mix with Native American speeches and an anonymous slave's letter, and the collection continues with a wide social, economic, political, and racial span, ultimately embracing a panoply of issues including black liberation, the environment, gay rights, workers' rights, and peace movements. While Young defines dissent as coming from both the Left and the Right in his introduction, left of center predominates. American Protest Literature is organized by Trodd around 11 subjects, which are collected more or less as they have arisen chronologically in our history, from \"Declaring Independence\" and \"Unvanishing the Indian\" to \"The Word Is Out: Gay Liberation\" and \"From Saigon to Baghdad.\" Within each area, Trodd presents writings from both the originating movement and the later protest writings on similar themes, e.g., Daniel De Leon's 1895 Declaration of Interdependence by the Socialist Labor Party is with Thomas Paine in the first section. There is less introductory material here than in Young's book, but by linking original works to later pieces Trodd underlines the historical roots of American dissent and the ongoing relevance of these writings. Trodd does not attempt to include right-of-center dissent, nor does her work contain literature on environmentalism or the long history of anti-imperialism, as does Young. Taken together, these books offer an exciting and inclusive vision of Americans fighting for their rights since the 17th century. Both are highly recommended for academic and public libraries.

The book was inspired, he notes in his preface, by his discovery that there was no wide-ranging compilation on the subject. O'Nan's selections, primarily excerpts from full-length works, include fiction by Tim O'Brien (<i>Going After Cacciato</i>, <i>The Things They Carried</i>), James Webb (<i>Fields of Fire</i>), Larry Heinemann (<i>Paco's Story</i>), Stephen Wright (<i>Meditations in Green</i>), and John Del Vecchio (<i>The 13th Valley</i>), plus excerpts from memoirs by Robert Mason (<i>Chickenhawk</i>), Ronald J. Glasser (<i>365 Days</i>), and Michael Lee Lanning (<I>The Only War We Had</i>). O'Nan also includes the lyrics of a variety of period songs ('The Ballad of the Green Berets,' 'Born in the USA'), critical summaries of films about the war, and some poetry. His adroit notes point out some of the most salient features of this literature (the relative neglect of the Vietnamese experience of war; the evolution of the American soldier protagonist from hero to cynical survivor; the persistent attempt to puzzle out what the war tells us about our society and government), and a glossary, bibliography, and chronology further help set the work in context. While the inclusion of more less-familiar writers would have been welcome, this is nonetheless a powerful, deeply revealing collection, and the best available introduction to a major body of modern American literature.<P></p>",

A profoundly moving statement of resilience and renewal.\"&mdash;<b>San Francisco Chronicle</b></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Coeditors Harjo (The Woman Who Fell from the Sky, LJ 11/15/94) and Bird (Full Moon on the Reservation, Greenfield Review, 1994) have put together a one-of-a-kind anthology of fiction, poetry, and memoir from over 80 Native women writers representing over 50 nations. Although nationally known writers such as Louise Erdrich, Linda Hogan, and Leslie Silko are included, many others are being published here for the first time. More than a collection of literature, this work is divided into four sectionsgenesis, struggle, transformation, and returningto illuminate the writing process. Each writer introduces herself and her philosophical perspective about writing, and the willingness to share personal stories makes this a work of rare beauty, truth, and power. In addition, the anthology also highlights the writers' views on universal concerns such as violence against women, poverty, alcoholism, depression, government/Native American relations, and, especially, identity and place.

    "overview": "<p>Cultural Writing. Poetry. Essays. As a leading interpreter of border life and culture, Allicia Gaspar Alba, a lesbian chicana poet, storyteller, and essayist explores the borders and limits of place, body, and language through a painful series of moves and losses. In sections divided into each of the places she visited in her travels, Alba incorporates the Mexican archetypal wailing woman who wanders in search of her lost children. LA LLORONA proves to be more than an archetype: it is a tour guide through the constant presence of the poet's voice. Alicia Gapar de Alba is also the co- editor of AZTLAN: A JOURNAL OF CHICANO STUDIES and the author of the acclaimed novel Sor Juana's Second Dream (University of New Mexico Press, 1999), and The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories (Bilingual Review Press, 1993). She is a professor of Chicano/a Studies and English at the University of California Los Angeles.</p>",

    "overview": "Witnessing Lynching: American Writers Respond is the first anthology to gather poetry, essays, drama, and fiction from the height of the lynching era (1889-1935). During this time, the torture of a black person drew thousands of local onlookers and was replayed throughout the nation in lurid newspaper reports. The selections gathered here represent the courageous efforts of American writers to witness the trauma of lynching and to expose the truth about this uniquely American atrocity. Included are well-known authors and activists such as Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Ida B. Wells, and Theodore Dreiser, as well as many others. These writers responded to lynching in many different ways, using literature to protest and educate, to create a space of mourning in which to commemorate and rehumanize the dead, and as a cathartic release for personal and collective trauma. Their words provide today's reader with a chance to witness lynching and better understand the current state of race relations in America.",

Wells, Carl Sandburg, and other authors/activists. Michele Wallace (City College of New York) provides further commentary on this horrific backdrop to current race relations.

    "overview": "<p>This year’s Best American Short Stories is edited by the critically acclaimed and best-selling author Barbara Kingsolver, whose latest book is Prodigal Summer. Kingsolver’s selections for The Best American Short Stories 2001 showcase a wide variety of new voices and masters, such as Alice Munro, Rick Moody, Dorothy West, and John Updike. “Reading these stories was both a distraction from and an anchor to the complexities of my life—my pleasure, my companionship, my salvation. I hope they will be yours.”—Barbara Kingsolver</p>",
    "excerpt": "<p>Foreword</p>\n<p>IN THE 1942 VOLUME of The Best American Short Stories, the anthology’s new annual editor, Martha Foley, attempted to define the form. “A good short story,” she wrote, “is a story which is not too long and which gives the reader the feeling he has undergone a memorable experience.” Over the past eleven years, during my own tenure as annual editor of this eighty-six-year-old series, I’ve run across numerous other writers’ attempts to come up with some sort of standard by which to measure the short story. Few have managed to add much to Ms. Foley’s democratic and rather obvious criteria.<br>\n At symposiums and writers’ conferences, I’ve learned to duck and weave around the inevitable question “What do you look for in a short story?” I wish I knew! Heart? Soul? Truth? Voice? Integrity of intention and skill in execution? The answer is all of the above, and none of the above. For I don’t really “look” for anything; when a story works, I know it in my gut, not in my head, and only then—after laughing, after brushing away a tear, after taking a moment to catch my breath and return to the here and now—do I set about analyzing the successes and failures of a writer’s effort. It would certainly be nice to have a checklist, a foolproof grading system, a tally sheet of pluses and minuses. But reading is a subjective activity, even for those of us who are fortunate enough to read for a living. We editors may read more pages than the average American, and we may read faster, but when it comes right down to it, I believe we all read for the same reason: in order to test our own knowledge of life and to enlarge on it.<br>\n Out of the three thousand or so short stories I read in any given year, I may file two hundred away. And I always marvel at how precious this stash of chosen fiction seems to me; these are the stories that, for one reason or another, exerted some kind of hold on the priorities of my heart. Even now, I have boxes of old stories, going back a decade and more, stacked up in the basement; I’ve saved every file card I’ve filled out since 1990 as well—a treasure trove of stories, a king’s ransom of human wisdom caught and held on those hundreds of moldering pages. When it comes to cleaning closets, I’m ruthless. But those stories . . . well, how could I throw them away? Who knows when a particular bit of fiction will prove useful? Someday, I think, someone will need that story about the emotional roller coaster of new motherhood; or this one, which reminds us what sixteen years old really feels like; or that one, which could help a friend prepare for death . . .<br>\n Toward year’s end, I sift through the current piles and begin to ship batches of tales off to the guest editor, always wondering whether he or she will share my tastes and predilections and curious to know whether the narrative voice that whispered so urgently in my ear will speak with as much power to another. Truth be told, it is an anxious time. Just as, when I was a teenager, I wanted my parents to agree that my boyfriend was indeed Prince Charming, I can’t help but hope that the guest editor will share my passion for the year’s collection of short story suitors.<br>\n I have no clue about Barbara Kingsolver’s taste in men, but I discovered right away that she and I could fall in love with the same short stories. And when her introduction to this volume came spooling through my fax machine, I stood there reading it page by page, nodding in agreement with her discoveries and full of gratitude for the pickiness (her word) and devotion she brought to this task of reading, judging, and finally choosing. And then, as the next-to-last page emerged into my waiting hands, I saw it: a new definition for the short story, at last. To Martha Foley’s sixty-year-old criteria we can now add Barbara Kingsolver’s useful dictum: “A good short story cannot simply be Lit Lite, but the successful execution of large truths delivered in tight spaces.” Writers take heed!<br>\n In choosing this year’s collection of The Best American Short Stories, Kingsolver has done writers and readers a great service, for her own love for the form and her exacting standards have resulted in a volume that is as varied in subject matter, style, voice, and intent as even the most eclectic reader could wish for. Collectively, these stories hum with the energy of twenty disparate voices raised under one roof. They are a testament to our contemporary writers’ vigorous engagement with the world and to the robust good health of American short fiction.<br>\n Some years ago, John Updike revealed, “Writing fiction, as those of us who do it know, is, beneath the anxious travail of it, a bliss, a healing, an elicitationn of order from disorder, a praise of what is, a salvaging of otherwise overlookable truths from the ruthless sweep of generalization, a beating offfff daily dross into something shimmering and absolute.” Mr. Updike, who made his first appearance in The Best American Short Stories in 1959, returns this year for the twelfth time as a contributor. (He also served as guest editor in 1984 and coedited The Best American Short Stories of the Century, published in 1999.) He is the only writer in the history of the series to appear in these pages for six consecutive decades—an achievement that we feel is worth noting. May he continue to beat the daily dross into such shimmering and absolute works as “Personal Archeology,” which begins on page 326.</p>\n<p>The stories chosen for this anthology were originally published between January 2000 and January 2001. The qualifications for selection are (1) original publication in nationally distributed American or Canadian periodicals; (2) publication in English by writers who are American or Canadian, or who have made the United States or Canada their home; (3) original publication as short stories (excerpts of novels are not knowingly considered). A list of magazines consulted for this volume appears at the back of the book. Editors who wish their short fiction to be considered for next year’s edition should send their publications to Katrina Kenison, c/o The Best American Short Stories, Houghton Mifflin Company, 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116.<br>\nK.K.</p>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED why short stories aren’t more popular in this country. We Americans are such busy people you’d think we’d jump at the chance to have our literary wisdom served in doses that fit handily between taking the trash to the curb and waiting for the carpool. We should favor the short story and adore the poem. But we don’t. Short story collections rarely sell half as well as novels; they are never blockbusters. They are hardly ever even block-denters. From what I gather, most Americans would sooner read a five-hundred- page book about southern France or a boy attending wizard school or how to make home decor from roadside trash or anything than pick up a book offering them a dozen tales of the world complete in twenty pages apiece. And I won’t even discuss what they will do to avoid reading poetry.<br>\n Why on earth should this be? I enjoy the form so much myself that when I was invited to be the guest editor for this collection, forewarned that it would involve reading thousands of pages of short fiction in a tight three-month period, I decided to do it. This trial by fire, I thought, would disclose to me the heart of the form and all its mysteries. Also, it would nicely fill the space that lay ahead of me at the end of the year 2000, just after my planned completion of a novel and before its publication the following spring. The creative dead space between galley proofs and a book’s first review is a dreaded time in an author’s life, comparable to the tenth month of a pregnancy. (I’ve had two post-term babies, so I know what I’m talking about.) I look at the prepublication epoch as a Great Sargasso Sea and always try to fill it with satisfying short- term projects. I reexamined the previous editions of this series on my shelf and considered the assignment. Amy Tan, who edited The Best American Short Stories 1999, described the organized pleasure of reading one story a day for three months. That sounded like a tidy plan to put on my calendar. Editing a story collection, plus a short family vacation to Mexico and a week-long stint lecturing on a ship in the Caribbean, would fill those months perfectly, providing just enough distraction from my prepublication doldrums.<br>\n If you ever want to know what it sounds like when the universe goes “Ha! Ha!” just put a tidy plan on your calendar.<br>\n My months of anticipated quiet at the end of 2000 turned out to be the most eventful of my life, in which I was called upon to attend to an astonishing number of unexpected duties, celebrations, and crises. I weathered a tour and publicity storm with the release of my new novel, eight months ahead of schedule. While handling this plus the lectures at sea, I learned of a family member’s catastrophic illness, I was invited to have dinner with President and Mrs. Clinton, and I took my eighth-grader to the funeral of her beloved friend—not to mention the normal background noise of family urgencies. These two months of our lives were stitched together by trains, automobiles, the M.S. Ryndam, and thirty-two separate airplane flights. (A perverse impulse caused me to save my boarding passes and count them.) Naturally this would be the year when I also experienced a true airplane emergency, and I don’t mean the garden- variety altitude plunge. I mean that I finally got to see what those yellow masks look like.<br>\n Through it all, as best I could, I read stories. On a cold Iowa afternoon with the white light of snowfall flooding the windows, sitting quietly with a loved one enduring his new regime of chemotherapy, I read about a nineteenth-century explorer losing his grasp on life in the Himalayas. On another day, when I found myself wide-eyed long after midnight on a ship so racked by storms that the books were diving off the shelves of my cabin, I amused myself with a droll fable about two feuding widows in the Pyrenees. I read my way through a long afternoon sitting on the dirty carpet of Gate B-22 at O’Hare, successfully tuning out all the mayhem and canceled-flight refugees around me, except for one young woman who kept shouting into her cell phone, “I’m almost out of minutes!” (This was not the same day my airplane would lose its oxygen; the screenwriter of my life isn’t that corny.) I read through a Saturday while my four-year-old dozed in my lap with a mysterious fever that plastered her curls to her forehead and burned my skin through her pajamas; I read in the early mornings in Mexico while parrots chattered outside our window. Some days I was able to read no stories at all—when my youngest was not asleep on my lap, for instance—and on other days I read many. Eighteen stories got lost in my luggage and took a trip of their very own, but returned to me in time.<br>\n My ideas about what I would gain from this experience collapsed as I began to wrestle instead with what I would be able to give to it. How could I read 125 stories amid all this craziness and compare them fairly? In the beginning I marked each one with a ranking of minus, plus, or double-plus. That lasted for exactly three stories. It soon became clear that what looks like double-plus on an ordinary day can be a whole different thing when the oxygen masks are dangling from the overhead compartment. I despaired of my wildly uncontrolled circumstances, thinking constantly, If this were my story, would I want some editor reading it under these conditions?<br>\n Maybe not. But the problem is, life is like that. Editors, readers, all of us, have to work reading into our busy lives. The best of it can stand up to the challenge—and if anything can do it, it should be the genre of short fiction, with its economy of language and revving plot-driven engine. We catch our reading on the fly, and that is probably the whole point anyway. If we lived in silent white rooms with no emergencies beyond the wilting of the single red rose in the vase, we probably wouldn’t need fiction to help us explain the inexplicable things, the storms at sea and deaths of too-young friends. If we lived in a room like that, we would probably just smile and take naps.<br>\n What makes writing good? That’s easy: the lyrical description, the arresting metaphor, the dialogue that falls so true on the ear it breaks the heart, the plot that winds up exactly where it should. But these stories I was to choose among had been culled from thousands of others, so all were beautifully written. I couldn’t favor (or disfavor) the ones by my favorite writers, because their authorship was concealed from me. I knew only that they had been published in magazines in the last year and preselected by the series editor, Katrina Kenison, who had done for me the heroic service of separating distinguished stories from the run-of-the-mill. My task was to choose, among the good, the truly great. How was I supposed to do it?<br>\n With a pile of stories on my lap, I sat with this question early on and tried to divine why it is that I love a short story when I do, and the answer came to me quite clearly: I love it for what it tells me about life. If it tells me something I didn’t already know, or that I maybe suspected but never framed quite that way, or that never before socked me divinely in the solar plexus, then the story is worth the read.<br>\n From that moment my task became simple. I relaxed and read for the pleasure of it, and when I finished each story, I wrote a single sentence on the first page underneath the title, in the space conveniently opened up for me where the author’s name had been masked out. Just one sentence of pure truth, if I’d found it, which generally I did. No bumpy air or fevers or chattering parrots could change this one true thing the story had meant to tell me. This is how I began to see the heart of the form. While nearly all the stories were expertly written, and most were pleasant to read, they varied enormously in the weight and value of what they carried—in whether it was sand or gemstones I held in my palm when the words had trickled away. Some beautifully written stories gave me truths so self-evident that when I wrote them down, I was embarrassed. “Young love is mostly selfish,” some told me, and others were practically lining up to declare, “Alcoholism ruins lives and devastates children!” In the privacy of my reading, I probably made that special face teenagers make when forced to attend to the obvious. Of all the days of my life, these were the ones in which I was perhaps most acutely aware that time is precious. So please, tell me something I don’t already know. Sometimes I couldn’t find anything at all to write in that little space under the story’s title, but most were clear enough in their intent, and many were interesting enough to give me pause. And then came one that rang like a bell. “An orphaned child needs to find her own peculiar way to her mother’s ghost, but then will need an adult to verify it.” As soon as I’d jotted that down, I knew this story had given me something I would keep. I slipped it into a pocket of my suitcase, and when I got home I set it on the deep windowsill beside my desk where the sun would fall on it in the morning, and over two months it would grow, I hoped, into a pile of stories. Words that might help me be a better mother, a wiser friend. I felt I’d begun a shrine to new truths, the gifts I was about to receive in a difficult time.<br>\n Slowly that pile did grow. Too slowly, I feared at first, for when I’d conquered nearly half my assigned reading, it still seemed very small. I am too picky, I thought. I should relax my standards. But how? You don’t lower the bar on enlightenment. I couldn’t change my heart, so I didn’t count the stories in my shrine, I just let them be what they were. Cautiously, though, I made another pile called “Almost, maybe.” If push came to shove, I would reread these later and try to be more moved by them.<br>\n If it sounds as if I’m a terribly demanding reader, I am. I make no apologies. Long before I ever heard the words (and I swear this happened; this pilot should go to charm school) “We’re going to try an emergency landing at the nearest airport that can read our black box,” it had already dawned on me that I’m not going to live forever. This means I may never get through the list of the great books I want to read. Forget about bad ones, or even moderately good ones. With Middlemarch and A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in the world, a person should squander her reading time on fashionably ironic books about nothing much? I’m almost out of minutes! I’m patient with most corners of my life, but put a book in my hands and suddenly I remind myself of a harrowing dating-game shark, long in the tooth and looking for love right now, thank you, get out of my way if you’re just going to waste my time and don’t really want kids or the long- term commitment. I give a novel thirty pages, and if it’s not by that point talking to me of till-death-do-us-part, sorry, buster, this date’s over. I’ve chucked many half-finished books into the donation box. You might be thinking right now that you’re glad I was never your writing instructor, and a few former students of mine would agree with you. Once in a workshop after I’d already explained repeatedly that brevity is the soul of everything, writing-wise, and I was still getting fifty-page stories that should have been twenty- page stories, I announced: “Starting tomorrow, I will read twenty- five pages of any story you give me, and then I’ll stop. If you think you have the dazzling skill to keep me hanging on for pages twenty- six-plus because my life won’t be complete without them, just go ahead and try.” I’m sorry to admit I was such a harpy, but this is a critical lesson for writers. We are nothing if we can’t respect our readers. It’s audacious enough to send a piece of writing out into the world (which already contains Middlemarch), asking readers to sit down, shut up, ignore kids or work or whatever important things they have going, and listen to me. Not for just a minute but for hours, days. It had better be important. The stories in this collection earned every minute I gave them, with interest. A few of them are long, but they dazzled me to the end. Most are short—some only three or four pages—and while they weren’t chosen for that reason, I admire them for it. Probably the greatest challenge of the form is to get a story launched and landed efficiently with a whole worthwhile journey in between. The launch is apparently easier than the landing, because I’ve been entranced by many a first paragraph of a tale that ended with such an unfulfilling thud that I scrambled around for a next page that simply wasn’t. It may be that most Americans don’t read short stories because they don’t like this kind of a ride. A good short story cannot simply be Lit Lite; it is the successful execution of large truths delivered in tight spaces. If all short fiction did it perfectly, more readers would surely sign up.<br>\n The stories in this book have survived my harpy eye on all accounts: they’ve told me something remarkable, they are beautifully executed, and they are nested in truth. The last I mean literally. I can’t abide fiction that’s too lazy to get its facts straight. People learn from what they read, they trust in words, and this is not a responsibility to take lightly. I’ve stopped reading books in which birds sang on the wrong continents or full moons appeared two weeks apart (it wasn’t set on Jupiter). I’ve tossed aside fiction because of botched Spanish or French phrases uttered by putative native speakers who were not supposed to be toddlers or illiterates. When faced with a mountain of stories to eliminate, my tools were sharp and unforgiving. One fascinating story was headed for my “Yes!” shrine until its physician narrator informed me authoritatively, “The opposable thumb is the only thing that separates us from lemurs and baboons.” Hooey—lemurs and baboons have opposable thumbs; that’s part of what defines them (and us) as primates. Biological illiteracy is a problem I care about, and I believe fiction should inform as well as enlighten, and first, do no harm.<br>\n For a story to make the cut, I asked a lot from it—asked of it, in fact, what I ask of myself when I sit down to write, and that is to get straight down to it and carve something hugely important into a small enough amulet to fit inside a reader’s most sacred psychic pocket. I don’t care what it’s about, as long as it’s not trivial. I once heard a writer declare from a lectern, “I write about the mysteries of the human heart, which is the only thing a fiction writer has any business addressing.” And I thought to myself, Excuse me? I had recently begun thinking of myself as a fiction writer and was laboring under the illusion that I could address any mystery that piqued me, including but not limited to the human heart, human risk factors, human rights, and why some people practically have to scrape flesh from their bones to pay the rent while others have it paid for them all their merry days, and how frequently the former are women raising children by themselves even though that wasn’t the original plan. The business of fiction is to probe the tender spots of an imperfect world, which is where I live, write, and read. I want to know about the real price of fast food in China, who’s paying it, and why. I want to know what it’s like in Chernobyl all these years later. Do you? This book will tell you.<br>\n Last week in my own living room I finished the last of the stories Katrina had sent me, including several batches of “very last ones.” After that final page I took a deep breath and went to my office to count the stories in my pile on the windowsill. There were twenty, exactly. I counted again. Unbelievable. I’d been asked to select twenty plus one extra “just in case,” but I couldn’t bear to go back through the “maybes” and pick an alternate. When life performs acts of grace for you, you don’t mess with the program.<br>\n I thank these twenty authors and offer their stories to you as pieces of truth that moved me to a new understanding of the world. When I look back now on the process, I understand that editing this collection was not a chore piled onto an already overscheduled piece of my life, but rather a kind of life raft through it. While the people around me in Gate B-22 swore irritably into their cell phones, I was learning how a man in an Iranian prison survived isolation by weaving a rug in his mind. The night after my teenager and I returned from her friend’s funeral and she asked me how life could be so unfair, I lay down on my bed to read of the pain and healing of a child from Harlem in 1938. These stories were, for me, both a distraction and an anchor. They were my pleasure, my companionship, my salvation. I hope they will be yours.<br>\nBARBARA KINGSOLVER</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2001 by Houghton Mifflin Company Introduction copyright © 2001 by Barbara Kingsolver</p>",

(Oct.) Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>In his introduction to Prize Stories 2001, editor Dark notes an increase in the number of longer stories, or novellas, being published in literary journals. To reflect this trend, Dark chose to publish three longer pieces, bringing the total number of stories in this year's volume to 17 rather than the usual 20. One of these, Mary Swan's \"The Deep,\" an absorbing account of twin sisters in the World War I era, was chosen as the best story of the year. Runners up were Dan Chaon's \"Big Me\" and Alice Munro's \"Floating Bridge.\" Munro also receives a special citation for her continued notable work in the short story form. Dark writes that he was torn between Munro's above-mentioned story and her equally fine \"Post and Beam;\" happily, the latter appears in Best American Short Stories 2001. Kingsolver narrowed her selections by opting for only those that \"tell me something I don't already know.\" So we get funny and intriguing views of other cultures, such as Ha Jin's \"After Cowboy Chicken Came to Town,\" which is about the workers in an American fast-food restaurant in China; Katherine Shonk's \"My Mother's Garden,\" set near post-disaster Chernobyl; and Trevanian's sly Basque fable, \"The Apple Tree.\" Two well-deserving stories, Elizabeth Graver's \"The Mourning Door\" and Andrea Barrett's \"Servants of the Map,\" appear in both volumes. Both volumes are valuable additions to academic and larger public libraries. Christine DeZelar-Tiedman, Univ. of Minnesota Libs., Minneapolis Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>An excellent new edition of this popular anthology. As might be expected from the author of several carefully researched novels (Prodigal Summer, 2000, etc.), guest editor Kingsolver suggests a predilection for stories with extraordinary content. In a lively introduction, she lays out three criteria for her selections: \"They've told me something remarkable, they are beautifully executed, and they are nested in truth.\" And most of the stories here do have \"something remarkable\" to tell. Rather than depicting the subtleties of \"everyday American life,\" these tales usually opt for more exotic subjects. Ha Jin's \"After Cowboy Chicken Came to Town\" depicts what it's like to work at an American fast food restaurant in China, while Peter Ho Davies's \"Think of England\" takes place in and around a Welsh countryside pub on the night after the D-day landing. Katherine Shonk's \"My Mother's Garden\" presents life near Chernobyl's contaminated zone, while Andrea Barrett's \"Servants of the Map\" centers on a British surveyor in the Himalayas during the 1860s. The stories not set in far-flung locations are often about unusual perspectives, like that of the morbidly obese man in Claire Davis's \"Labors of the Heart\" or of the character in Rick Bass's ultra-factual \"The Fireman.\" Such tales can leave one with the feeling of having read nonfiction as much as fiction. Kingsolver allows quotidian subject matter only if it's in the hands of an Alice Munro (\"Post and Beam\") or a John Updike (\"Personal Archeology\"). Younger writers-a generous number are here-have to earn their way by writing about Hong Kong, Madagascar, or Buffalo in the1930s. Also of interest is a posthumously published story by the HarlemRenaissance writer Dorothy West (1907-98). A vibrant, diverse collection.\n\n</article>"

    "excerpt": "<p>Introduction Dead Men Talking</p>\n<p>For young readers and young writers, here are half a dozen commonplaces concerning the act of reading, required or otherwise:</p>\n<p>1. Dr. Johnson: “A man ought to read just as inclination leads him; for what he reads as a task will do him little good.” In principle I agree with this—but I’m not quite this sort of reader. Not confident enough to be this reader. “Inclination” is all very well if you are born into taste or are in full possession of your own, but for those of us born into families who were not quite sure what was required and what was not—well, we fear our inclinations. For myself, I grew up believing in the Western literary canon in a depressing, absolutist way: I placed all my faith in its hierarchies, its innate quality and requiredness. The lower-middleclass, aspirational reader is a very strong part of me, and the only books I wanted to read as a teenager were those sanctified by my elders and betters. I was certainly curious about the nonrequired reading of the day (back then, in London, these were young, edgy men like Mr. Self and Mr. Kureishi and Mr. Amis), but I didn’t dare read them until my required reading was done. I didn’t realize then that required reading is never done.<br>\n My adult reading has continued along this fiercely traditional and cautiously autodidactic path. To this day, if I am in a bookshop, browsing the new fiction, and Robert Musil’s A Man Without Qualities happens to catch my eye from across the room, I am shamed out of the store and must go home to try to read that monster again before I can allow myself to read new books by young people. Of course, the required nature of The Faerie Queene, books 3 through 10 of Paradise Lost, or the Phaedrus exists mostly in my head, a rigid idea planted by a very English education. An education of that kind has many advantages for the aspiring writer, but in my case it also played straight and true to the creeping conservatism in my soul. Requiredness lingers over me. When deciding which book of a significant author to read, I pick the one that appears on reading lists across the country. When flicking through a poetry anthology, I begin with the verse that got repeated in the .lm that took the Oscar. I met an Englishwoman recently, also lower middle class, who believed she was required to read a book by every single Nobel laureate, and when I asked her how that was working out for her, she told me it was the most bloody miserable reading experience she’d ever had in her life. Then she smiled and explained that she had no intention of stopping. I am not that bad, but I’m pretty bad. It is only recently, and in America, that the hold required reading has had on me has loosened a little.<br>\n Tradition is a formative and immense part of a writer’s world, of the creation of the individual talent—but experiment is essential. I have been very slow to realize this. Reading this collection made me feel the literary equivalent of “Zadie, honey, you need to get out more”; I began to see that interesting things are going on, more and more things, and that I can’t keep up with them, and that many of them cause revolt in the required-reading part of my brain (I get very concerned by the disappearance of some of the more expressive punctuations: the semicolon, the difference between long and short dashes, the potential comic artfulness of the parentheses), and yet, I so enjoyed myself that even if what I have read in this book is the clarion call of my own obsolescence, it seems essential to defend experiment and nonrequiredness from those who would attack it.<br>\n Thing is, the very young and very talented are not beholden. Nor are the readers who would approach them. The great joy of nonrequiredness seems to me that as a young reader, you have this opportunity to hold opinions that are not weighed down by the opinions that came before. It is up to you to measure the worth of the writers in your hand, for you are young and they are young and actually I am still young and we are all in this thing together. And I feel pride when I see that, collectively, we are not only writing and reading weird stories, but also writing and reading serious journalistic nonfiction and comics and satire and histories, and we are doing all these things with the sort of rigor and attention that no one expected of us, and we are managing this rigor and attention in a style entirely different from our predecessors’. We are so good, in fact, that we cannot hope to stay nonrequired very long. We, too, will soon become required, which comes with its own set of problems.</p>\n<p>2. Logan Pearsall Smith: “People say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading.” How important is the “touch of the real”? Should the young man hankering after a literary life read through his massive dictionaries or stand upon a pile of thhhhhem to reach the high shelf where the whiskey is kept? When I was in my teens, making a few stabs at writing, I had a very low opinion of experience. It did not seem to me that trekking to the cobwebbed corners of the world for six months and returning with a pair of ethnic trousers made anybody a more interesting fellow than when they left. Weary, stale, .at, and unprofitable were all the uses of the world to me—which meant, of course, that I was not much good at anything and had no friends. No matter what anybody says, it is a mixture of perversity and stomach-sadness that makes a young person fashion a cocoon of other people’s words. If the sun was out, I stayed in; if there was a barbecue, I was in the library; while the rest of my generation embraced the sociality of Ecstasy, I was encased in marijuana, the drug of the solitary. It was suggested to me by a teacher that I might “write about what you know, where you live, people you see,” and in response I wrote straight pastiche: Agatha Christie stories, Wodehouse vignettes, Plath poems—all signed by their putative authors and kept in a drawer. I spent my last free summer before college reading, among other things, Journal of the Plague Year, Middlemarch, and the Old Testament. By the time I arrived at college I had been in no countries, had no jobs, participated in no political groups, had no lovers, and put myself in no physical danger apart from an entirely accidental incident whereupon I fell fifty feet from my bedroom window while trying to reach for a cigarette I’d dropped in the guttering. In short, I was perfectly equipped to go on to write the kind of fiction I did write: saturated by other books; touched by the world, but only very vicariously. Welcome to the house that books built: my large rooms wallpapered with other people’s words, through which one moves like a tourist through an English country manor—somewhat impressed, but uncertain whether anyone really lives there.<br>\n These days, given the choice between a week in the Caribbean and a week reading A High Wind in Jamaica, I would probably still choose the book and the sofa. But this is no longer a proud rejection, only a stiffened habit. To read many of the pieces in this collection is to discover the uses of the world, of experience, is to be shown how life can indeed be the thing, if only you let it. I am impressed by this strong, noble, journalistic trend in American writing, to be found in this very book, dispassionately exercising itself over Saddam’s daily existence, or what it is like to live in South Central L.A. I had never met with this kind of journalism until I came to America. It has since been explained to me that most Americans read In Cold Blood when they are fifteen, but I read it only two years ago, and not since Journal of the Plague Year had I felt writing like that, and I mean felt it; writing that gets up inside you, physically, giving you back the meaning of the word unnerve. When you read too many novels, and then when you happen to write them as well, you develop a sort of hypersensitivity to the self- consciously “literary” as it manifests itself in fictional prose—it’s a totally irrational, violent, and self-defeating sensitivity, and you know that, but still, every time you see it, including in your own stuff, it makes you want to scream. So to read what purports to be the truth—no matter how decorated—feels to me like the palate-cleansing green tea that follows a busy meal of monosodium glutamate.<br>\n The point is, my mind has changed about experience. I thought I didn’t like memoirs, I thought I didn’t like travelogues, I thought I didn’t like autobiographical books written by people under forty, but the past three years of American writing have proved me wrong on all these counts. It is never too late to change your mind about what you require. I see now that I am required, and more than this, that I require, I need, to do something else with my life than solely to read fiction and write it. I’ve got to get out there, abroad and up close; I’ve got to smell things, eat them, throw them across a park, sail them, dig them up, and see how long I can survive without them, or with them.</p>\n<p>As I write this, I am at a college with a novelist younger than me, and at a recent lunch he put before me a hypothetical choice. Should a young man stay the university distance for those four long years? Or should he drop out and seek the experiences that are owed him? Which decision makes the better writer? I argued the case for college, listing the writers on my side of the Atlantic who stayed the course even while indulging in such various activities as storing a bear in their room (Byron), ditching class to walk up hills (Wordsworth), spending most of the time having suits made (Wilde), stopping soccer balls at the goal’s mouth (Nabokov), or scribbling obscenities in library books (Larkin). He naturally countered with all the Americans who quit while they were ahead, or earlier (Mark Twain, William Faulkner, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Jack London). He won the argument because I had no experience with which to argue against it. By definition Emersonian experience cannot be rejected without any experience of it; it must be passed through and felt and only then compared to the Miltonic experience: the dark room, a book, the smell of the lamp. I’m not qualified to make the judgment, no, not yet—although I intend to be. I want to travel properly next year. See some stuff. In the meantime, maybe we should heed the advice of the Web site www.education- reform.net/dropouts.htm and Shaun Kerry, M.D. (diplomate, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology), who comes down firmly on the side of life:</p>\n<p>Ultimately, what distinguishes the aforementioned individuals from the rest of us is their passion for learning that transcends the structured environment of the classroom. Instead of limiting their education to formal schooling, they were curious about the world around them. With their fearless spirit of exploration and their desire to experiment, these individuals discovered their true passions and strengths, which they built upon to achieve success later in life.<br>\n Imagine what a loss for the world it would have been if Walt Disney had confined his learning to the requirements of his school’s curriculum, and followed only the guidance of his teachers, rather than his own internal motivation. His extraordinary animated features may have never been created.</p>\n<p>Imagine.</p>\n<p>3. Laurence Sterne: “Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine; they are the life, the soul of reading.” Yet, somehow, digressions have gone and got themselves a bad name. The name might be indulgence. Digressions, supposedly, are for writers who cannot control themselves, or else writers who seek to waste the hard-earned time of the no-bullshit reader who has little patience for frippery. The attitude: Writer, do not take me down this strange alley when I mean to get from A to B, and don’t think that, just because I am from the Midwest or Surrey, I’ll allow some New York or London wiseass to take me on an unnecessary, circuitous journey and charge me too much while they’re at it. And less of the chat—I don’t need a tour guide—Christ, I know this city like the back of my hand. And please note that I’m man enough to use honest language like “back of my hand,” which is more than you can say for these namby-pamby writers.<br>\n And then on the other side of the street, you’ve got your folks who care only for digression. They don’t feel they’ve got their money’s worth unless, while trying to get from Williamsburg to the Upper East Side, the writer takes them by way of Nairobi, a grandparent’s first romance, the Guadeloupean independence struggle of the 1970s, through the stink of the Moscow sewer system and up through the bud-mouth of an unborn child. But these folks are few.<br>\n Among the majority, digression has fallen from favor, along with many of the great digressors, of which Sterne was the mighty progenitor. Maybe “digression” has been confused and twinned with “complexity,” but if that’s so, then someone should explain that a path off a main road needn’t be busy or populated—it can be plain, flat, straight, almost silent. But for all digressions to be of this kind would seem to me a shame. To be so strict about it, I mean. I do like a sunny, busy lane. And I like a memory-saturated, melancholic one as well. I think of W. G. Sebald’s The Emigrants, that ode to digression, structured like a labyrinth of lanes leading away from a historical monument that is itself too painful to be looked at directly. This might be a model. Things are so painful again just now.<br>\n Maybe I worry too much about these things, but like a silent minority of transvestite schoolboys and wannabe drag kings, I imagine a whole generation of not-yet-here writers who feel great shame when contemplating their closet full of adjectival phrases, cone-shaped flashbacks, multiple voices, scraps of many media, syzygy, footnotes, pantoums. I worry that they will never wear them out for fear of looking the fool.<br>\n Look: Wear your black some days, and wear your purple others. There is no other rule besides pulling it off. If you can pull off, for example, blocks of red and yellow in horizontal stripes, feathers, tassels, lace, toweling, or all-over suede, then for God’s sake, girl, wear it.<br>\n Here is a beautiful digression from a master digressor. He is meant to be discussing his sixteen-year-old cousin, Yuri:</p>\n<p>He was boiling with anger over Tolstoy’s dismissal of the art of war, and burning with admiration for Prince Andrey Bolkonski—for he had just discovered War and Peace which I had read for the first time when I was eleven (in Berlin, on a Turkish sofa, in our somberly rococo Privatstrasse flat giving on a dark, damp back garden with larches and gnomes that have remained in that book, like an old postcard, forever).</p>\n<p>4. James Joyce: “That ideal reader suffering from an ideal insomnia” The ideal reader cannot sleep when holding the writer he was meant to be with.<br>\n Sometimes you meet someone who is the ideal reader for a writer they have not yet heard of. I met a boy from Tennessee at a college dinner who wore badly chipped black nail polish and a lip ring, had perfect manners, and ended any disagreement or confusion with the sentence “Well, I’m from Tennessee.” He was the ideal reader for J. T. Leroy and did not know it, having never heard of him. This was a very frustrating experience. Multiple recommendations did not seem sufficient—I wanted to take him at that moment, in the middle of the dinner, to the bookstore so he might meet the two novels he was going to spend the rest of his life with.<br>\n A cult book, of course, is one that induces the feeling of “being chosen as ideal” in every one of its readers. This is a rare, mysterious quality. The difference between, for example, a fine book like Philip Roth’s The Human Stain and a cult book like J. D. Salinger’s Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters is that no one is in any doubt that Roth’s book was written for the general reader, whereas a Salinger reader must fight the irrational sensation that the book was written for her alone. It happens more often in music: Prince fans thought Prince their own private mirage; all the boys who liked Morrissey thought he sang for each of them; I had the same feeling with the initial album of Marshall Mathers, and also the .rst time I heard Mozart’s Requiem. It is all of it delusional, probably, like simultaneous orgasm, but to think of oneself as the perfect receptacle for an artwork is one of the few wholly benign human vanities.</p>\n<p>Ideal reading is aspirational, like dating. It happens that I am E. M. Forster’s ideal reader, but I would much prefer to be Gustave Flaubert’s or William Gaddis’s or Franz Kafka’s or Borges’s. But early on Forster and I saw how we suited, how we fit, how we felt comfortable (too much so?) in each other’s company. I am Forster’s ideal reader because, I think, nothing that he left on the page escapes me. Rightly or wrongly, I feel I get all his jokes and appreciate his nuances, that I am as hurt by his flaws as I am by my own, and as pleased when he is great as I would be if I did something great. I know Morgan. I know what he is going to say before he says it, as if we had been married thirty years. But at the same time, I am never bored by him. You might know three or four writers like this in your life, and likely as not, you will meet them when you are very young. Understand: They are not the writers you most respect, most envy, or even most enjoy. They are the ones you know. So my advice is, choose them carefully so that people don’t roll their eyes at you at parties (this happens to me a lot).<br>\n The definition of a genius might be the reader who is ideal for multiple writers, each of them as dazzling and distant from each other as religions.<br>\n Maybe you are the ideal reader for a writer in this collection.</p>\n<p>5. Sir Francis Bacon: “Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.” I’ve tried to deal a little with how full reading can make you, and how empty also. “Conference” we can file alongside “experience”—it is the main portion of experience. Otherwise known as the necessary habit of rubbing up against people in the world, other people and their variousness. The central significance of such rubbing, or frotting, being that it plays a key part in forming the kind of human being who might one day write a book that isn’t utterly phony and doesn’t make you feel sick when you read it.<br>\n “If fiction isn’t people it is nothing, and so any fiction writer is obligated to be to some degree a lover of his fellowmen, though he may, like the Mormon preacher, love some of them a damn sight better than others.” Wallace Stegner said that, and though Wallace Stegner is not the reason I wake up in the morning, if you don’t believe that sentence in some small part then you have no business writing fiction at all. You don’t know what it is. And you’re probably right, the medium is beneath you, it is dying, it is intellectually defunct—so why don’t you just leave it alone, go on, move along now. It’s a silly business—leave it to fools.<br>\n But if you are going to continue with it, then meet some people, won’t you? Care for them, conference with them. It will make you ready. Nobody contains within themselves multitudes, no, not Shakespeare, not Dickens, not Tom Wolfe, not nobody. You need to get some conference. Ready—this is absolutely the right word. I am not ready. Are you?<br>\n On Sir Francis’s last point: It is a commonplace to say that writing is a kind of exactitude, and it feels natural enough (to the writer) to speak of writing as the act of striving for precision, of making the artwork on the page a replica of the ideal artwork in one’s mind. Particularly if the writer is on a festival panel and cornered suddenly by a question regarding “process,” then she will most likely answer along these broadly Platonic lines, while retaining a guilty sense that the truth is more ambivalent, and too liquid to grasp in your hand and throw to the questioner with the microphone at the back of the hall.<br>\n When I write, the kind of exactitude that most concerns me is a bit tricky to explain. I’ll try, quickly. So you know the rhythm and speed of reading? Okay, keep that in mind. Now remember the rhythm and speed of writing—the jaggedy, retentive, tortured, unnatural lack of flow. Okay. Now to me, the mystery of exactitude lies in finding the perfect fit between what you know it is to write and what you know it is to read. If you are writing, and have forgotten the rhythm and speed and, actually, the texture, of what it is to read, you’re in trouble. But at the same time, to keep the idea of reading in mind too strongly while you’re writing is to grow fearful at the keyboard, dreading all that you might write that would be complex, awkward, resistant (to the ear, to the brain), intimate, and seemingly unshareable.<br>\n Mr. Stegner called writing the “dramatization of belief.” I find it useful to think of that phrase as pertinent not simply to what appears on the page in terms of narrative content but to the relation between two opposite, but umbilically connected, acts: reading and writing. To me, each writer’s prose style dramatizes their belief regarding what reading may demand of writing and vice versa. Hemingway, for example, believed in the primacy of reading; he thought that there should be no artificial interruption in its natural smoothness and speed. He subjugated the vanities of writing to the realities of reading. Nabokov, on the other hand, thought Hemingway was a Philistine. Nabokov thought reading should equal the performative act of writing, that it should be a reenaction of the act of writing (although no reader, except possibly his wife, proved equal, in Nabokov’s mind, to the task).<br>\n Somewhere between the writing that has forgotten entirely what reading is and the writing that is a slave to what reading is—that’s where I try to be.<br>\n (N.B. I guess you know how Sir Francis Bacon died.)</p>\n<p>6. Vladimir Nabokov: “A work of art has no importance whatever to society. It is only important to the individual, and only the individual reader is important to me.” Role models—individuals endowed with wide-ranging sociosymbolic significance—have no place in fiction. Role models are bullshit. People who move through the world playing roles, attending to roles, aspiring to roles, looking for models to help them find new roles—these people are not partaking fully in this whole existence-thing, which is about doing it for real. We would rather not read that way (leaning over a pond, waiting for the water to settle, and all so our own mirrored faces might rise toward us like Plath’s “terrible fish”), no, nor write that way either. To this some folks will object. Oh, I see. So you’re not political. No! Don’t believe it! You are political! You are the most political fucking person in the world because when you read, when you write, you won’t let a single human being be obscured behind the dread symbolic bulk of somebody or something else. Every time you open a novel or put pen to paper you dramatize your belief in the miraculous, incommensurable existence of a society of six billion individuals. One of whom died three hundred and seventy-seven years ago while attempting to freeze a chicken.</p>\n<p>—Zadie Smith</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2003 by Houghton Mifﬂin Company.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Short stories are not meant for short attention spans; the best are as dense and nuanced as a good chocolate truffle. Selected by writer Eggers and his 826 Valencia workshop students, many of the 24 stories in this fourth volume of the \"Best American Nonrequired Reading\" series are delights. In the best short story tradition, they provoke interest quickly and linger in the memory long after. Cartoon, nonfiction, and quirky short pieces are included among the predominantly traditional short stories, and there's a nice mix of established and lesser-known writers whose offerings range from the mordant wit of Douglas Trevor's \"Girls I Know\" to Jhumpa Lahiri's beautifully crafted \"Hell-Heaven\" to Amber Dermont's moving and funny \"Lyndon.\" George Saunders's and Molly McNett's pieces also stand out. Noteworthy among the nonfiction pieces is William Vollmann's \"They Came Out Like Ants,\" about Chinese immigrants living in Mexacali tunnels. The eclectic mix in this anthology shares some recurring motifs: troubled childhoods, a feeling for the woes of American outsiders, and a sort of melancholic irony about the world. A representative and worthwhile holding for public and academic libraries.-Laurie Sullivan, Sage Group Int'l., Nashville Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Fiction and nonfiction pulled from the main- and side-stream by McSweeney's editor Eggers, founder of a San Francisco writing lab for city youth, is the latest in Houghton Mifflin's Great American Series. Even with forewords from inaugural guest editor Eggers (A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, 2000) and series editor Michael Cart, a well-known YA author, the new category \"nonrequired\" is less than clear. Even so, there are pieces from old standbys Esquire, Atlantic Monthly, the New York Times Magazine, and, yes, the New Yorker, cheek by jowl with bits from the Onion, Optic Nerve, Spin, and ZYZZYVA. Though aimed at younger-than-boomer readers, the pieces are not necessarily by or about the less-than-middle-aged. Eric Schlosser's \"Why McDonald's French Fries Taste So Good\" is a fascinating but almost geekily well-researched piece about the flavor enhancement biz; it educates even though it was probably chosen to appeal to vegan terrorists and their supporters. Adrian Tomine's \"Bomb Scare,\" from Optic Nerve, is a gloomy and graphic high-school-life-sucks-so-bad piece that goes on nearly as long as high school. Karl Taro Greenfield's \"Speed Demons,\" from Time, clearly explains the appeal of meth and other uppers. While a number of pieces have been included as comic relief, only David Sedaris (unsurprisingly) and the Onion bits (\"Local Hipster Overexplaining Why He Was At The Mall\" and \"Marilyn Manson Now Going Door To Door Trying To Shock People\") are likely to crack anybody up. Perhaps the truly cool don't want to be caught guffawing. Rodney Rothman's almost-nonfiction \"My Fake Job,\" disowned by the New Yorker, is amusing but so dryly that there's no danger of snorting or snotflying. The sentimental favorite is a long, wonderful piece from Sports Illustrated, of all places, by Gary Smith, about a black coach who brings magic to an Amish community in Ohio. Readers who aren't reduced to blubbering should seek medical attention. An alternative to the Banana Republic gift certificate for that difficult nephew with a birthday.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From the Publisher</h4>\"An excellent literary compilation . . . Eggers deserves credit for another first-rate collection.\" Publishers Weekly\n\n</article>"

Harper (1825-1911)</p>\n<p>Very soon the Yankee teachers<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came down and set up school;<br>\nBut, oh! how the Rebs did hate it,--<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was agin' their rule.</p>\n<p>Our masters always tried to hide<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Book learning from our eyes;<br>\nKnowledge didn't agree with slavery--<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould make us all too wise.</p>\n<p>But some of us would try to steal<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little from the book,<br>\nAnd put the words together,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn by hook or crook.</p>\n<p>I remember Uncle Caldwell,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who took pot-liquor fat And greased the pages of his book,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hid it in his hat.</p>\n<p>And had his master ever seen<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves upon his head,<br>\nHe'd have thought them greasy papers,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing to be read.</p>\n<p>And there was Mr. Turner's Ben,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who heard the children spell,<br>\nAnd picked the words right up by heart,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learned to read 'em well.</p>\n<p>Well, the Northern folks kept sending<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yankee teachers down;<br>\nAnd they stood right up and helped us,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Rebs did sneer and frown.</p>\n<p>And, I longed to read my Bible,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For precious words it said;<br>\nBut when I begun to learn it,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folks just shook their heads,</p>\n<p>And said there is no use trying,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Chloe, you're too late;<br>\nBut as I was rising sixty,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no time to wait.</p>\n<p>So I got a pair of glasses,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight to work I went,<br>\nAnd never stopped till I could read<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hymns and Testament.</p>\n<p>Then I got a little cabin--<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place to call my own--<br>\nAnd I felt as independent<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the queen upon her throne.</p>\n<p><b>George Moses Horton</b> (1797?-1883?), author of \"The Slave's Complaint\"</p>\n<p>George Moses Horton, at his best, was a poet of daring intensity and vast ambition. Born about 1797 in Northhampton County, North Carolina, he was a slave for most of his life, until Emancipation in 1865. Horton, who taught himself to read, found his way into the hearts of many unwitting belles of North Carolina through his selling of personalized love lyrics to students at nearby Chapel Hill. He furthered his education by borrowing what books he could from these students.</p>\n<p>Many of Horton's best poems concern the topic of slavery. His \"On Hearing of the Intention of a Gentleman to Purchase the Poet's Freedom,\" \"On Liberty and Slavery,\" and \"The Slave's Complaint\" examine the slave's position in clean and learned verses. \"George Moses Horton, Myself\" captures in its paced, cool contemplativeness and terse lyrics some of the unresolved strivings of the poet.</p>\n<p>Horton had hoped to purchase his freedom with the sales of his first book of poems, <i>The Hope of Liberty</i> (published in Raleigh in 1829), the first full volume of verse published by an African American since Phillis Wheatley's some thirty years before. But he fell short of this goal, living instead through three generations of Horton ownership.</p>\n<p><i>The Hope of Liberty</i> was reissued in 1837 in Philadelphia under the title <i>Poems by a Slave</i>. Horton's second volume, <i>Naked Genius,</i> came to print in 1865, the year in which he escaped to the Northern infantry then occupying Raleigh. Little was heard of Horton after this point, and it is generally assumed that he lived the remainder of his life in Philadelphia, where he died in about 1883.</p>\n<p><b>Frances E. W. Harper</b> (1825-1911), author of \"Learning to Read\"</p>\n<p>Frances Ellen Watkins Harper was born free in Baltimore in 1825. By the time of her death in 1911, she had become almost an institution in both literary and political circles. Harper used what seems to have been a tireless energy to publish countless poems, articles, essays, and novels examining both racial and gender division among Americans. Often thought of as the inaugural \"protest poet,\" she presented her themes in graceful rhetoric, skillful metaphor, allusion, and allegory, embracing the demands of her craft along with the exigencies of the social moment.</p>\n<p>Harper worked ably and extensively in her lifetime with the Underground Railroad, the Maine Anti-Slavery Society, the Women's Christian Temperance movement, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the American Equal Rights Association, the Universal Peace Union, the National Council of Women, and the National Association of Colored Women. Her <i>Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects</i> was published in 1854, with a preface by William Lloyd Garrison. This volume proved so popular that it went through over twenty reprints in the author's lifetime.</p>\n<p>Harper was also the author of <i>Moses: A Story of the Nile,</i> published in 1869, <i>Poems</i> in 1871, and <i>Sketches of Southern Life</i> in 1873. <i>Iola Leroy,</i> one of the more widely read novels written by an African American of the nineteenth century, was published in 1893.</p>",

Major names are well represented, and new voices are also included, which many teachers and students may not have heard of yet, but will appreciate. There is a good balance of men and women, and I was especially impressed with the inclusion of many poets producing work before 1900. What makes special this collection special is the general introduction, along with the biographies that introduce the work of each poet. The introduction articulates clearly the history of African American poetry, and emphasizes the political and historical context of the poems. The editors then use the work of Sterling A. Brown as a model for investigating and understanding the work of each individual poet. Each biography provides basic facts and summary of the work, and also some evaluation of style, topic and form, which will help both students and teachers study and appreciate the poetry. There is no index, but there is an accessible, chronologically arranged table of contents at the beginning and a Selected Bibliographies section at the end. This is a valuable and inexpensive addition to all libraries, which will likely pique the interest of YA poets and non-poets alike.

Beginning with Olaudah Equiano's 1789 slave narrative and ending with Congresswoman Maxine Waters's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 1992 on the Los Angeles riots, this welcome anthology brings together a diversity of voices. It includes fiction, autobiography, poetry, songs, and letters by such writers as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and Richard Wright. Many topics are covered, from slavery, education, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and political issues to spirituals, songs of the Civil Rights movement, and rap music. To conclude, there's the surprising addition of Jesse Jackson's 1984 address to the Democratic National Convention. This book supersedes Richard A. Long and Eugenia W. Collier's Afro-American Writing: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry (Pennsylvania State Univ. Pr., 1985). Essential for literary collections.-- Ann Burns, ``Library Journal''</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This is an unusual array of writings by African Americans. Beginning with Olaudah Equiano's 1789 slave narrative and ending with Congresswoman Maxine Waters's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 1992 on the Los Angeles riots, this welcome anthology brings together a diversity of voices. It includes fiction, autobiography, poetry, songs, and letters by such writers as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and Richard Wright. Many topics are covered, from slavery, education, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and political issues to spirituals, songs of the Civil Rights movement, and rap music. To conclude, there's the surprising addition of Jesse Jackson's 1984 address to the Democratic National Convention. This book supersedes Richard A. Long and Eugenia W. Collier's Afro-American Writing: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry (Pennsylvania State Univ. Pr., 1985). Essential for literary collections.-- Ann Burns, ``Library Journal''\n\n</article>"

Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, e. e. cummings, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, and Gertrude Stein, as well as significant works of lesser-known American poets.<p>From the Revolutionary and Civil Wars to the Romantic Era and the Gilded and Modern Ages, this unrivaled anthology also presents a memorable array of rare ballads, songs, hymns, spirituals, and carols that echo through our nation's history. Highlights include Native American poems, African American writings, and the works of Quakers, colonists, Huguenots, transcendentalists, scholars, slaves, politicians, journalists, and clergymen.<p>These discerning selections demonstrate that the American canon of poetry is as diverse as the nation itself, and constantly evolving as we pass through time. Most important, this collection strongly reflects the peerless stylings that mark the American poetic experience as unique. Here, in one distinguished volume, are the many voices of the New World.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In the exceedingly brief, almost offhand introduction to this chunky anthology, the editors assert that \"there ain't no canon,\" and that their aim is to hold out \"an invitation to the reader of today and to those poets whose names we do not yet know.\" Such sloppy vagaries aside, one assumes that their intent is to represent diversity of a sort, but in fact two-thirds of the volume is made up of 19th-century poetry covered far more thoroughly in the Library of America's American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century (LJ 9/1/93), and no rationale is given for the rather strange cut-off date of 1923--unless it has something to do with copyright. There are the usual heavy doses of Whitman, Dickinson, and Stevens, a smattering of spirituals, popular song lyrics, and Native American poems, along with an occasional dash of obscure names such as Ellen Sturgis Hooper and Lucretia Davidson. But given its lack of headnotes or other supporting scholarly materials, this is yet one more hastily contrived, redundant anthology no one has been waiting for. Not recommended.--Fred Muratori, Cornell University Lib., Ithaca, NY</p>",

    "overview": "<p>More than 35 passages from novelists, journalists, poets, playwrights, essayists, and scientists detail an intertwined passion for diving and the written word in this collection. From Robert Stone’s portrayal of a diver who faces the terrorizing prospect of his air running out to Clare Booth Luce's search for the treasures of the underwater realm, every passage reveals a perspective of the world that only divers have known. Humor columnist Dave Barry battles a lobster and explains why staying on the ocean’s surface is like “going to the circus and staring at the outside of a tent.” From Rangiroa to the Red Sea, from deep within caverns to the eerie light under ice, from the lethal silliness of nitrogen narcosis to the elation of soaring over unfathomable depths, every selection, like every dive, is a unique experience.</p>",
    "excerpt": "<p>To halt and hang attached to nothing, no lines or air pipe to the surface, was a dream. . . . From this day forward we would swim across miles of country no man had known, free and level, with our flesh feeling what the fish scales know.</p>\n<p>I experimented with all possible maneuvers of the aqualung—loops, somersaults, and barrel rolls.&nbsp; I stood upside down on one finger and burst out laughing, a shrill distorted laugh. Nothing I did altered the automatic rhythm of air.&nbsp; Delivered from gravity and buoyancy I flew around in space.\"</p>",

Divided into four sections-\"A New Attitude,\" \"New Bones,\" \"Roots,\" and \"In Search of Satisfaction\"-these works focus on relationships, health, spirituality, and other relevant topics. An English professor throws a ball rather than a party in honor of her 50th birthday, a poet says good-bye to her monthly cycle, two doctors discuss menopause myths, a broadcast journalist tells of the joys of adoption, and a woman's health activist comments on safe sex among seniors. Such writers as Nikki Giovanni, Diane Donaldson, Miriam Decosta-Willis, and Maya Angelou speak of the fear of aging, dealing with breast reduction surgery, facing the death of a spouse, and finding romance. Whether these women are celebrating or bemoaning the process of growing old, the result is a wonderful compilation.

    "overview": "Literary Nevada is the first comprehensive literary anthology of Nevada. It contains over 200 selections ranging from traditional Native American tales, explorers' and emigrants' accounts, and writing from the Comstock Lode and other mining boomtowns, as well as compelling fiction, poetry, and essays from throughout the state's history. There is work by well-known Nevada writers such as Sarah Winnemucca, Mark Twain, and Robert Laxalt, by established and emerging writers from all parts of the state, and by some nonresident authors whose work illuminates important facets of the Nevada experience. The book includes cowboy poetry, travel writing, accounts of nuclear Nevada, narratives about rural life and urban life in Las Vegas and Reno, poetry and fiction from the state's best contemporary writers, and accounts of the special beauty of wild Nevada's mountains and deserts. Editor Cheryll Glotfelty provides insightful introductions to each section and author. The book also includes a photo gallery of selected Nevada writers and a generous list of suggested further readings.",

    "overview": "Can a middle-aged, middle-class woman survive, when she suddenly has to make beds all day in a hotel and live on $7 an hour? Maybe. But one $7-an-hour job won’t pay the rent: she’ll have to do back-to-back shifts, as a chambermaid and a waitress. This isn’t the first surprise for acclaimed author Barbara, who set out to research low-wage life firsthand, confident she was prepared for the worst. Barbara Ehrenreich’s best-seller about her odyssey is vivid and witty, yet always deeply sobering. Joan Holden’s stage adaptation is a focused comic epic shadowed with tragedy. Barbara is prepared for hard work but not, at 55, for double shifts and nonstop aches and pains; for having to share tiny rooms, live on fast food because she has no place to cook, beg from food pantries, gulp handfuls of Ibuprofen because she can’t afford a doctor; for failing, after all that, to make ends meet; or for constantly having to swallow humiliation. The worst, she learns, is not what happens to the back or the knees: it’s the damage to the heart. The bright glimpses of Barbara’s co-workers that enliven the book become indelible portraits: Gail, the star waitress pushing fifty who can no longer outrun her troubles; Carlie, the hotel maid whose rage has burned down to disgust; Pete, the nursing home cook who retreats into fantasy; Holly, terrified her pregnancy will end her job as Team Leader at Magic Maids, and with it her 50-cent raise. These characters wage their life struggles with a gallantry that humbles Barbara, and the audience. The play shows us the life a third of working Americans now lead, and makes us angry that anyone should have to live it.",

Peter Maloney's Leash is set in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. And for variety's sake, Deborah Brevoort's Blue Moon Over Memphis is a Noh Drama about Elvis Presley. Other plays rounding out the collection include Jordan Harrison's Fit for Feet ; Mary Gallagher's Perfect ; and Lavonne Mueller's The Wounded Do Not Cry , the latter inspired by the life of Frances Slanger, forgotten heroine of the Normandy invasion. Susan Miller's The Grand Design was staged in Los Angeles at the Canon Theatre in an evening of original one act plays benefiting Cure Autism Now, starring Lily Tomlin and Eric Stoltz, It was also performed by Marsha Mason and Scott Cohen at Town Hall in New York City for Brave New World, a marathon of plays commemorating 9/11.

Harris was born in Eatonton, Georgia, where he served as an apprentice on a plantation during his teenage years. He spent the majority of his adult life in Atlanta working as an associate editor at the Atlanta Constitution. Harris led two significant professional lives. Editor and journalist Joe Harris ushered in the New South alongside Henry W. Grady, stressing regional and racial reconciliation during and after the Reconstruction era. Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, recorded many Brer Rabbit stories from the African-American oral tradition and revolutionized children's literature in the process.\"</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>In <i>The American Aeneas</i>, John C. Shields exposes a significant cultural blindness within American consciousness. Noting that the biblical myth of Adam has long dominated ideas of what it means to be American, Shields argues that an equally important component of our nation's cultural identity--a secular one deriving from the classical tradition-has been seriously neglected. <P> The author finds various Early American texts, including pastorals, pastoral elegies, literary independence poems, tracts on educational theories, religious discourses, and political writings, laden with elements of classicism, particularly the myth of Aeneas as depicted by Vergil. Shields demonstrates that Aeneas, Vergil's hero of the <i>Aeneid</i>, was an especially apt figure for New World discourse in that he epitomized \"the sailor who struck out onto dangerous, uncharted seas in order to discover a new land in which to build a new civilization. \"Shields shows how both the myth of Adam and the myth of Aeneas, in crossing over to America from Europe, dynamically intermingled in the thought of the earliest American writers. This rearticulation of the myths of Adam and Aeneas became peculiarly adapted to the demands of the American adventure in freedom. Shields argues that uncovering and acknowledging the classical roots of our culture can allay the American fear of \"pastlessness\" that the long-standing emphasis on the Adamic myth has generated. <P> The author's probing analysis sheds new light on the works of such seminal figures as Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Phillis Wheatley, George Washington, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville. But it does much more than that--it posits a new model for American studies. \"This model,\" Shields writes, \"is not composed of a single strand which can only direct the struggle to explore the dimensions of American culture in a linear fashion--an inevitable dead end. The image of two strands coming together, intertwining and interconnecting so as to accommodate virtually infinite possibilities, more accurately captures the dynamic of Americanness.\"</p>",

So, why is the American imagination enthralled by <i>The Sopranos</i>, and other portraits of Italian-ness?</p>\n<p>Italian American identity, now a mix of history and fantasy, flesh-and-bone people and all-too-familiar caricature, still has something to teach us, including why each of us, as citizens of the U.S. twentieth century and its persisting cultures, are to some extent already Italian. Contending that the media has become the primary vehicle of Italian sensibilities, Ferraro explores a series of books, movies, paintings, and records in ten dramatic vignettes. Featured cultural artifacts run the gamut, from the paintings of Joseph Stella and the music of Frank Sinatra to <i>The Godfather</i>’s enduring popularity and Madonna’s Italian background. In a prose style as vivid as his subjects, Ferraro fashions a sardonic love song to the art and iconography of Italian America.</p>",

The book is an important contribution not only to Italian American studies, but to the understanding of ethnicity in the 21st-century US.”<br>\n-<i>Choice</i></p>\n<p>,</p>\n<p>“<i>Feeling Italian</i> is a smart book, one that makes the reader think beyond the usual ways of looking at what’s Italian about the US.”<br>\n-<i>American Book Review</i></p>\n<p>,</p>\n<p>“This inspired, sophisticated, provoking book should command the attention of anybody interested in American Italianness in particular or the cultural consequences of ethnicity in general. Joseph Stella and Frank Sinatra, Maria Barbella and Giancarlo Esposito, Madonna and the good people who brought you the Corleones and Sopranos—;they and others appear here, often seen in startlingly fresh ways, as creators and exemplars of the aesthetic Tom Ferraro calls ‘feeling Italian.’ Wise, funny, contagiously enthusiastic, Ferraro takes us far beyond the narrow pieties of the identity police or anti-defamation types as he traces the development of a widely accessible American cultural style that still bears the marks of distinctively Italian ways of making do and making sense.”<br>\n-Carlo Rotella,author of <i>Good With Their Hands: Boxers, Bluesmen, and Other Characters from the Rust Belt</i></p>\n<p>“Original and deeply right. There is no other book that digs so deeply into the matter at hand, and does so with such eloquence and ferocity of intellect.”<br>\n-Jay Parini,author of <i>Passage to Liberty: The Story of Italian Immigration and the Rebirth of America</i></p>\n\n\n</article>"

Many of the pieces here deal with the struggles of women&#151;especially adolescents&#151;trying to accept that competition is good, that winning is even better, and that it's possible to be both a woman and an athlete without slighting either. Stephanie Grant's story \"Posting-Up\" offers a tough- minded description of the manner in which her adolescent narrator discovers the exhilaration of playing basketball well and aggressively. \"Scotti Scores,\" by Jane Gilliland, carries the idea a step further, exploring how the members of a high-school hockey team astonish themselves and their coach by cooperating to outplay a far more experienced team. Stories by Laurie Colwin, Ellen Gilchrist, Sara Maitland, and Jennifer Levin are particularly strong, as are the excerpts from novels by Carol Anshaw and Sara Vogan. Some tales suffer from seeming too programmatic, too thin and message-laden. But, overall, a useful introduction to an overlooked area in contemporary fiction and poetry.<P></p>",

Christie interprets the selections with passionate (though somewhat scary in their expressive distortion) acrylic-and-pencil illustrations that could stand alone as a lively introduction to modern art. The poems were created during a community workshop designed to \"introduce children to the techniques of image and metaphor, narrative and dialogue, and then set them free to explore their own lives, feelings and imaginations.\" Occasionally these goals are reached, as when Thelma Louise Lee writes of \"my brother-trying to wash dishes/and me-talking too much, me hitting/my cousin (not meaning to, really),/me playing basketball and/calling all the shots.\" However most of the short poems, printed with boldface emphasizing certain words (Black, family, freedom) lack original imagery and come across as slogans rather than as personal voices. Facilitators of \"everybody's an author\" writing classes seeking a range of examples may be interested in purchasing The Palm of My Heart. Stronger writing and a broader range of topics can be found in June Jordan and Terri Bush's Voice of the Children (Holt, 1970; o.p.)-Karen MacDonald, Teaticket Elementary School, MA\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>A collection of works, subtitled \"Poetry by African American Children,\" that showcases an exciting new artist whose style is unique and fully realized.\n<p>The 20 pieces that Adedjouma gathered from writing workshops are not poems but thoughts, musings, and statements occasionally infused by a poetical phrase or notion. The themes are arranged seamlessly, and the selections are life-affirming, brimming with self-awareness, and written in a celebration of African American culture. The real story here is the glorious art by picture-book newcomer Christie, who displays a fine-arts sensibility that is incorporated into his illustrations, looking as if the influence of African art has been distilled through Klee and Picasso in the 1920s, with a touch of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Yet Christie's art remains all his own. Elongated limbs and abstract backgrounds emphasize the skill of his portraiture, drawing viewers to the astoundingly accomplished painting of individual faces. His interpretations of the text elevate its feeble nature and allow every page and double-spread to convey a distinct story, mood, or tribute to the culture. With an introduction by Lucille Clifton.</p>\n\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<p>This annotated bibliography of 19th-century literature by and about American textile factory workers examines 457 texts, including novels, short fiction, poetry, drama, narratives, and children's literature, and offers new insights into 19th-century working-class culture. The textile industry was the premier and largest 19th-century industry in the United States. The texts, drawn from a variety of publications, such as workers' periodicals, mainstream publishers' monographs, newspapers, magazines, story papers, dime novels, pulp publications, and Sunday-school tracts, reveal the variety and complexity of the factory literature and represent the largest body of American working-class women's literature. The literature explores a number of women's concerns, such as their roles as workers, sexual harassment, marriage, motherhood, and homosexual and heterosexual relationships, and treats the factory work experience of hundreds of thousands of 19th-century children. Annotations are divided among 14 topical chapters that highlight such key issues as women's independence, class bias, child labor, technology, and protest. Most entries include information on text availability, including microform reprints and U.S. library holdings for rare titles.</p>\n<p>Scholars of 19th-century women's literature and history will value the full picture of 19th-century factory women's lives that emerges through the synopses of the literature. This work includes the first literary depictions of and protest against child labor, the first anti-factory poem, and the first fictional depiction of a strike. The more than 50 annotated texts that treat child labor offer new source material for the study of child labor in 19th-century America. Appendices furnish a chronological listing of titles, a selection of nonfiction texts, and a listing of unavailable texts.</p>",

A Children's Choices award winner and a School Library Journal Best Book.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>Gr 5 Up-- In light of the gifts Native peoples have given to Western culture , they still remain the silent voice in the political, cultural, economic, and spiritual resonance of America. This text seeks to send a voice to the rest of American culture, through the eyes, ears, minds, and hearts of young Native Americans. These poems, stories, songs, and essays cover a span of over 100 years--1887-1990. In a time when many of these young people faced forced assimilation and loss of cultural identity, the common thread uniting their works was one of survival, continuance, and lastly hope. Hirschfelder and Singer have included extensive biographical information on each of the students who contributed to the anthology. The book is divided into six sections, with subject headings as ``Identity,'' ``Family,'' ``Homelands,'' ``Ritual and Ceremony,'' ``Education,'' and ``Harsh Realities.'' This is no romanticized version of Native American life, but rather a picture of traditions that survived through the courage of children. It's an excellent source for social studies and English classes, as well as a fine book for general reading, as it effectively conveys modern Indian life. --Carolyn M.

More than 100 pieces are organized by subjects such as forefathers, relationships, racism, sports, music and other themes that define the black man's experience. There are contributions from notables James Baldwin, Countee Cullen, Ralph Ellison, Jackie Robinson, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., but the editors also include material from emerging creative writers and political thinkers. The powerful opening excerpt by Frederick Douglass evokes his boyhood as a slave, and the collection closes with an eloquent discussion of the race problem today by Cornel West. A distinguished addition to black studies. Illustrations not seen by PW. (Mar.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>The editors' attempt to gather essays, poems, and segments of larger works as well as short stories covering every aspect of the black man in America-past, present, and future-explains this book's thickness. Their scope is truly comprehensive; selections range from some of the great names of literature and history to figures who are currently in vogue. But if you already have a reasonable collection of works by and about African Americans, you may find this offering to be somewhat redundant. Readers would have been better served by a smaller book of new essays to represent each theme and a bibliography referring to the theme's seminal works. Recommended for libraries that do not have much to offer in their coverage of black studies; otherwise, an optional purchase.-Anita L. Cole, Miami-Dade P.L. System, Fla.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Booknews</h4>An anthology of writing by black men, about black men. Authors such as W.E.B. Dubois, Ralph Ellison, Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, Kareem Abdul- Jabbar, Alex Haley, and Ice T explore the black man's experience as adolescent, lover, husband, father, worker, warrior, and elder in some 100 selections arranged by issues such as forefathers, male bonding, relationships with family and women, racism, class, sports, politics, and music.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>The New York Times</h4>Although <i>Americans in Paris</i> has a chronological structure, Mr. Gopnik still gives it a soupçon of suspense: the reader moves from section to section wondering whether the book can top what it has just delivered. So ignore the table of contents and allow yourself to be caught off guard. — <i>Janet Maslin</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Covering over three centuries of the American experience in Paris, this engaging and powerful anthology of letters, stories, and essays collects emotions of the heart and personal insights experienced by travelers trying to find happiness in the City of Light. Each selection engages the reader in a historical journey to a city that over the centuries has lured Americans, whether statesmen, soldiers, or tourists. The diverse pieces range from Benjamin Franklin's letter to Mary Stevenson in 1767, describing his first observations of the city, to fashion editor Diana Vreeland's memorable journeys to Paris as a representative of Harper's Bazaar after her reopening of the French collections following World War II. Other pieces are by such renowned travelers as Mark Twain, Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and many others. Edited by New Yorker staff writer Gopnik (Paris to the Moon), winner of the National Magazine Award for Essay and Criticism and the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting, this delightful literary anthology will compel readers to keep coming back to experience Paris.

    "overview": "In 1880, Joel Chandler Harris, a moderate white Southern journalist, published a collection of black folktales, proverbs, songs, and character sketches based on stories he had heard as a child. In his introduction, Robert Hemenway discusses the book's enduring popularity, pointing out that the character of Uncle Remus, the docile and grandfatherly ex-slave storyteller, is a utopian figure-a literary creation by Harris that reassured white readers during the tense and tentative Reconstruction. By contrast, the feisty Brer Rabbit was a mainstay of black folklore long before Harris heard of his exploits. Brer Rabbit's cunning and revolutionary antics symbolically inverted the slave-master relationship and satisfied the deep human needs of a captive people.\n\n                        <p>Presents the legends, songs, and sayings of Uncle Remus, following the text of the first edition of Joel Chandler Harris' attempt to record traditional black stories of his time.\n</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>According to Wikipedia: \"Joel Chandler Harris (December 9, 1845 - July 3, 1908) was an American journalist, fiction writer, and folklorist best known for his collection of Uncle Remus stories. Harris was born in Eatonton, Georgia, where he served as an apprentice on a plantation during his teenage years. He spent the majority of his adult life in Atlanta working as an associate editor at the Atlanta Constitution. Harris led two significant professional lives. Editor and journalist Joe Harris ushered in the New South alongside Henry W. Grady, stressing regional and racial reconciliation during and after the Reconstruction era. Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, recorded many Brer Rabbit stories from the African-American oral tradition and revolutionized children's literature in the process.\"</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><br>This companion volume to the award-winning anthology, When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple, illuminates the experiences of women, young and old, reflecting on the choices they have made. In these stories and poems we see how women's alternatives are both extended and limited by personal belief systems, ethnic and cultural identity, class and economic status, age, and gender. Whether exploring significant public events or small private choices, these word portraits resonate with authenticity and meaning.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Lacking the eccentricity and distinctiveness of its bestselling predecessor, When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple (on women and aging), also edited by Martz, this new volume on the theme of the choices women make throughout their lives is simplistic at best. The language of most stories and poems here is uninventive and often cliched; themes are staid. ``A child is growing somewhere / in this weary world, / an innocent unwary / of emotions shattered,'' writes Shirley Vogler Meister in a sing-song, rhyming poem about adoption; and the narrator of Stephany Brown's story, whose boyfriend promptly enlisted in the Army when at 16 she told him she was pregnant, says that ``having his baby is still the best thing I ever did.'' Too many of these pieces have haunting echoes of a campaign for Family Values. Reading these pages, one would assume women no longer make choices other than having children vs. having an abortion, marriage vs. divorce, or which boy to date. A few excellent tidbits--Janice Levy's story about a Mexican woman entering the U.S. illegally and working as a maid or Pat Schneider's poem about a sister choosing to be a nun--are not enough to make this volume worth reading. 70,000 first printing.

The language of most stories and poems here is uninventive and often cliched; themes are staid. ``A child is growing somewhere / in this weary world, / an innocent unwary / of emotions shattered,'' writes Shirley Vogler Meister in a sing-song, rhyming poem about adoption; and the narrator of Stephany Brown's story, whose boyfriend promptly enlisted in the Army when at 16 she told him she was pregnant, says that ``having his baby is still the best thing I ever did.'' Too many of these pieces have haunting echoes of a campaign for Family Values. Reading these pages, one would assume women no longer make choices other than having children vs. having an abortion, marriage vs. divorce, or which boy to date. A few excellent tidbits--Janice Levy's story about a Mexican woman entering the U.S. illegally and working as a maid or Pat Schneider's poem about a sister choosing to be a nun--are not enough to make this volume worth reading. 70,000 first printing. (Feb.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Denise Perry Donavin</h4>The editor of \"When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple\" has pulled together another collection about the choices women make. In these essays, recollections, stories, and poetry by females of various ages, whining voices blend with mellower ones to share lessons learned and questions still unanswered. Topics range from wedding-day jitters to the recollection of a honeymoon; from summer vacations to terminal illness. As in the previous collection, the writing quality varies, but the result is still a rewarding medley.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women</h4>In <i>If I Had My Life to Live All Over I Would Pick More Daisies</i>, women again join their voices to examine the decisions women everywhere make every day, decisions that rend the heart, split the mind&amp;#8211having a baby or an abortion; giving a child up; caring for an elderly parent, having a career or giving it up.<br>\n—Phyllis Hyman\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Ruth Moose</h4>You buy a copy of <i>If I Had My Life to Live Over I Would Pick More Daisies</i>to give to a friend, because you have to share it and you can't bear to part with your own copy…And she buys a copy of the book for her friend and so the chain goes.<br>\n—Ruth Moose,<i>Encore Magazine</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Sara Sanderson</h4>We know these women.

    "synopsis": "<p>Beginning in 1950 with Charles Olsen, <b>Postmodern American Poetry&#58; A Norton Anthology</b> is the first anthology since Donald Allen&rsquo;s groundbreaking collection to fully represent the movements of American avant-garde poetry.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Concentration and magnification make the best anthologies work, and this may be one of them. Concentration: the focus on a body of writing with a heritage, an era, or a style in common that tests shared visions and constraints. Magnification: an expanse that seems to widen and deepen as we are allowed to take a look at it, and then another look. For anyone carping at the idea of the postmodern or the avant-garde as wanly intellectual, fiercely separatist, beside the point, or even nonexistent, Hoover's large-scale collection of recent experimental American poetry (and a concluding selection of essays about it) should persuade that it's not. He brings together more than 100 writers from the 1950s and since--Olson, Duncan, O'Hara, Ginsberg, Corso, Dorn, Major, Ashbery, Guest--whose adventures with the language renew it for far more than a readymade membership. The fact that some of the poets are sine qua nons and others aren't simply leaves the whole tribe more interesting. There's almost no point in listing names, except to indicate breadth; the same could be said for the ``schools'' represented. For literary positions have a way easing from their own strictures and outgrowing acolytic expectation when the words themselves are richly transformed and reformed--as they are here. Hoover is the editor of New American Writing. (Apr.)</p>",

The thread that binds together the poetry, short stories and essays collected here is the harmonious relationship between women and nature that is about ``caring rather than controlling,'' as editor Anderson indicates. In her poem ``My Help Is in the Mountainsic ,'' Nancy Wood ( Hollering Sun ) becomes part of the sun-warmed rock that soothes her ``earthly wounds.'' In a prose reflection, ``The Miracle of Renewal,'' Laura Lee Davidson is rejuvenated by a year spent in the Canadian woods in 1914, which provided her with a ``gallery of mind-pictures.'' Both Linda Hogan's essay, ``Walking,'' and Elizabeth Coatsworth's poem, ``On the Hills,'' seek and find continuity in nature, as well as a kinship with the other times and places that is evoked by it. Taste and sensitivity are evident throughout the volume, whether tacit as nocturnal solitude or vocal as a feline ``howl . . . for the flame of yellow moons'' in Judith Minty's poem, ``Why Do You Keep Those Cats?'' Anderson is a freelance writer and editor. QPB selection. (Apr.)</p>",

The thread that binds together the poetry, short stories and essays collected here is the harmonious relationship between women and nature that is about ``caring rather than controlling,'' as editor Anderson indicates. In her poem ``My Help Is in the Mountainsic ,'' Nancy Wood ( Hollering Sun ) becomes part of the sun-warmed rock that soothes her ``earthly wounds.'' In a prose reflection, ``The Miracle of Renewal,'' Laura Lee Davidson is rejuvenated by a year spent in the Canadian woods in 1914, which provided her with a ``gallery of mind-pictures.'' Both Linda Hogan's essay, ``Walking,'' and Elizabeth Coatsworth's poem, ``On the Hills,'' seek and find continuity in nature, as well as a kinship with the other times and places that is evoked by it. Taste and sensitivity are evident throughout the volume, whether tacit as nocturnal solitude or vocal as a feline ``howl . . . for the flame of yellow moons'' in Judith Minty's poem, ``Why Do You Keep Those Cats?'' Anderson is a freelance writer and editor. QPB selection. (Apr.)\n\n</article>"

This sourcebook of Halloween lore spans British, Irish, Scottish, French, Canadian, and American literature from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, from Robert Burns, W. B. Yeats, and James Joyce to Edgar Allan Poe, Edith Wharton, and H. P. Lovecraft. Each of the poems, stories, and plays in this anthology provides a link to Halloween celebrations of the past. Treasures abound, such as a rare Halloween mention in a colonial American play and a French journalist's retelling of a night spent amongst the bones of a Breton charnel house. The \"Hallowoddities\" section includes witch-trial testimony, journal entries, and other spooky pieces related to Halloween.",

Included are the works of Robert Burns, H. P. Lovecraft, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, and many more.<P>Lesley Pratt Bannatyne is also the author of Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History ($14.95 pb) and A Halloween How-To: Costumes, Parties, Decorations, and Destinations ($17.95 pb).</p>",

The attention to Continental developments as well as central Anglo-American texts distinguishes the volume from others now available to students. The range of writers, the judiciousness of the selection, and the expert introduction should make this the leading text in the field.\" <i>Professor Michael Levenson, University of Virginia</i></p>\n<p>\"He has been marvelously selective.

An excellent introduction provides a critical overview and helps put the pieces in their historical and literary context. The works reflect the development of a Chicana consciousness from its first seeds until the present. A section on ``foremothers'' collects oral and written pieces dating back to the 19th century. In one, from 1877, an aged widow recalls the deviously charitable way some priests got her a job. Sandra Cisneros, Alma Villanueva and Gloria Anzaldua provide numerous selections each, as do up-and-coming writers, such as Ines Hernandez or Marina Rivera, who offers a meditation on what it means to be of mixed blood. The title comes from Bernice Zamora's fine Whitmanesque poem about the infinitely divisible nature of identity. The pieces, however, are far too brief; most are mere snippets. Thus the editors merely whet the appetite but fail in their intention to make available hard-to-find Chicana literature. (June)</p>",

This collection, which includes 178 texts by 56 women, is organized historically and thematically. The first chapter includes early narratives from both oral and written traditions. Later chapters focus on personal identity, relationships within the community, and archetypes and myths. Authors include Gloria Anzaldua, Denise Chavez, Sandra Cisneros, Margarita Cota Cardenas, Pat Mora, and Antonia Quantana Pigno. Introductory essays set the tone for each new chapter, and extensive footnotes are included. Texts originally in Spanish are presented in both Spanish and English. This anthology will take its place in academic libraries with serious Hispanic American collections.-- Mary Margaret Benson, Linfield Coll ., Lib ., McMinnville, Ore.\n\n</article>"

The selections are drawn from Britain and North America, but also from Africa, Asia, Oceania, the Middle East, and the Caribbean&#151;wherever English is spoken. While classics of fiction, poetry, and drama are provided, the text also includes essays, song lyrics, letters, diary entries&#151;even excerpts from domestic handbooks and a graphic memoir&#151;to represent the full range of women&#8217;s voices. And Cultural Coordinates essays provide insights into customs and costumes from purdah to life before the Pill. To expand the choice of novels instructors wish to assign, McGraw-Hill also offers works from Library of Women's Literature at a discount.</p>",

For the mag's 40th anniversary, the editors have collected some of its most memorable essays, including Mark Jacobsen's 1975 \"Night-Shifting for the Hip Fleet\" (which loosely inspired the television show Taxi, Nik Cohn's Tribal Rights of the New Saturday Night and, in turn, the film Saturday Night Fever), two Gloria Steinem essays (including her brilliant 1969 manifesto, \"After Black Power, Women's Lib\"), and other articles from the likes of Jay McInerney, George Plimpton, Nora Ephron, Joe Klein, and current New York regulars Kurt Anderson and Emily Nussbaum. More recent favorites include Steve Fishman's \"The Dead Wives Club, or Char in Love,\" about a group profile of Staten Island firemen's wives widowed on 9/11, and Mark Jacobson's \"The $2,000-an-Hour Woman,\" a 2005 piece on \"America's No. 1 escort\" (whose colleague would later bring down Gov. Eliot Spitzer). Highlights abound, including Wolfe's classic 1976 \"The 'Me' Decade,\" which details the yuppy phenomenon's \"great religious wave\" of narcissistic self-discovery for \"dreary little bastards\" with money. A pleasure to read, this book will satisfy anyone wishing to reminisce about New York City and the birth of New Journalism. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All rights reserved.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4><p>To celebrate its 40th anniversary, <i>New York</i> magazine editors Fishman, Adam Moss, and John Homans present the most thought-provoking and culturally influential articles from the past four decades of the magazine. Founded by Clay Felker in 1968, the magazine highlighted life, culture, and politics in New York City and later included American society at large. Felker strived to compete with the prestigious <i>New Yorker</i> as the purveyor of ideas and culture among the Manhattan literati. More edgy and hip than its competitor, <i>New York</i> featured the writings of such notables as Gloria Steinem, Gail Sheehy, and Tom Wolfe. Its influence on popular culture is evident in several selections in this anthology. Nicholas Pileggi's \"Wiseguy\" and Nik Cohn's \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\" became the groundbreaking films <i>Goodfellas</i> and <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, respectively. This is not just a collection of great stories from the past 40 years; it is a study of the historical and sociological ideas and events that shaped the nation during that time. Highly recommended, especially for larger public libraries and academic libraries.<br>\n—Donna Marie Smith</p>\n\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<p>In the nineteenth century, Alexis de Tocqueville suggested that the poetry of the new American democratic state, free from the staggering weight of centuries of European aristocracy and tradition, would focus on \"man alone... his passions, his doubts, his rare properties and inconceivable wretchedness.\"</p>\n<p>For hundreds of years, American poets have presented their various images of the land and its people. But what is \"American poetry?\" Is there truly such a thing as an American poetic tradition, spanning over nearly four centuries from colonial times to the turn of the millennium? In <i>The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry,</i> Jay Parini, a respected American poet and critic in his own right, offers an authoritative survey of the elusive category that is the poetry of the American people.</p>\n<p><i>The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry</i> covers all of the canonical American poets, from the colonial to the contemporary-Anne Bradstreet, Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Adrienne Rich are all included.</p>\n<p>But Parini has also selected a broad sampling of poetry from voices that have been heard as widely over the years. Here, for the first time, is a thorough collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry by women, Native American, and African Americans. Within these pages readers will find the many different traditions that make up the expansive collage of American poetry. Here are the Transcendentalists-Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and Henry David Thoreau; and the Imagists-William Carlos Williams, Amy Lowell, H.D., and Carl Sandburg.</p>\n<p>Readers will discover also the early twentieth-century movement of African-American poetic expression, known as the Harlem Renaissance-James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Langston Hughes are all solidly represented in <i>The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry.</i></p>\n<p>Jay Parini's introduction deftly guides us into the rich tradition of poetry in our country. Whether in search of a well-known classic or a poem that is not yet considered part of the American poetic tradition, readers will find much to enjoy in <i>The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry.</i></p>\n<p> Columbia University Press</p>\n\n\n                        <p>American poetry from pre-Revolutionary times to the present excluding the work of poets born after WWII is sampled in The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry, edited by poet and teacher Jay Parini. Leading poets from three centuries are well-represented, with the works of less well-recognized writers, e.g., Frances Sargent Osgood and Alice Carey in the 19th century, Claude McKay and Jean Toomer in the 20th, sprinkled throughout. Although this is a hefty, comprehensive compilation, Parini accurately observes in his excellent introduction, \"I have merely skimmed the cream, as I see it, of American poetry.\"\n</p>",

Stimpson</h4>Like poetry or dislike it, use and enjoy the new <i>Columbia History of American Poetry.</i> There are riches here for all intellects and imaginations.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>The recent torrent of specialized anthologies spotlighting individual styles, ethnicities, periods, and themes argues for at least one new omnibus that embraces the 400-year spectrum of American poetry with ecumenism. Ranging from Anne Bradstreet to Louise Glck, editor Parini aims to represent \"the main schools of poetry that have co-existed in the United States...in proportion to their influence,\" including more poetry by women and minorities \"than one generally finds\" in older anthologies. One grants him the latter assertion prima facie-pieces by neglected poets like Lone Adams and Claude McKay are welcome-but the former claim, vague as it is, invites debate, especially since the 20th-century selections seem unduly constrained by a bland, university-press conservatism. How else can one explain the presence of academic contemporaries Dave Smith and Robert Pack at the expense of important avant-garde influences such as George Oppen and William Everson? Or accept Anne Stevenson in the absence of Barbara Guest? The familiar essentials aside, such questionable inclusions and omissions render American poetry in a dimmer light than it deserves. Recommended for large collections only.-Fred Muratori, Cornell Univ. Lib., Ithaca, N.Y.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booknews</h4>To the canonical poets, from the colonial to the contemporary, Parini has added a welcome collection of 19th- and 20th-century poetry by women, Native Americans, and African Americans (including a solid representation of the Harlem Renaissance). Cavils will no doubt follow from the narrow-minded and the mean-spirited, but this is the anthology to own in our time. Essential for every collection. (RC) Annotation c.

This year I read several, but I just couldn't get as worked up about them as I did the plays I selected.

The first two plays were produced by Second Stage as part of their summer series. <i>The Butcher of Baraboo</i> is about a small-town woman whose husband has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and the town gossips suspect that she done it. <i>Election Day</i> is about a local mayoral election and examines with amusing dexterity why we vote the way we do. <i>Spain</i> was produced Off Broadway by MCC at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. It's about a young woman who believes that there's a sixteenth-century Spanish conquistador in her living room. <i>Harvest</i> is a touching drama about a farmer who refuses to give up his farm, even ashe is going under. He manages to hold onto his farm but not his wife, who didn't bargain for a life of poverty and struggle. <i>Neighborhood 3: Requisition of Doom</i> is a drama about a group of teenagers in a suburban neighborhood obsessed with an online video game set in their community, who come to believe that they are being invaded by aliens from outer space-who look suspiciously like their parents. It was produced to acclaim by Actors Theatre of Louisville at their 2008 Humana Festival and subsequently at the 2008 Summer Play Festival in New York. <i>100 Saints You Should Know</i> comes to us from Playwrights Horizons and is about a single mom looking for something to believe in and a Catholic priest who has decided to leave the church as he has lost his faith. <i>Unconditional</i> was produced by LAByrinth Theater Company at The Public Theater. Of its three disparate stories, the central one is about a human resources worker who becomes enraged when he is laid off after many years on the job and just a short while from retirement and the pension he was counting on.</p>\n<p>All these plays represent the best of American playwriting. I hope you like them as much as I do, but more important, I hope you produce them!</p>\n<p>-Lawrence Harbison<br>\nBrooklyn, New York</p>",

He manages to hold onto his farm but not his wife, who didn't bargain for a life of poverty and struggle. <I>Neighborhood 3: Requisition of Doom</I> is a drama about a group of teenagers in a suburban neighborhood obsessed with an online video game set in their community, who come to believe that they are being invaded by aliens from outer space-who look suspiciously like their parents. It was produced to acclaim by Actors Theatre of Louisville at their 2008 Humana Festival and subsequently at the 2008 Summer Play Festival in New York. <I>100 Saints You Should Know</I> comes to us from Playwrights Horizons and is about a single mom looking for something to believe in and a Catholic priest who has decided to leave the church as he has lost his faith. <I>Unconditional</I> was produced by LAByrinth Theater Company at The Public Theater. Of its three disparate stories, the central one is about a human resources worker who becomes enraged when he is laid off after many years on the job and just a short while from retirement and the pension he was counting on.<P>All these plays represent the best of American playwriting. I hope you like them as much as I do, but more important, I hope you produce them!<P>-Lawrence Harbison<br>Brooklyn, New York</p>",

    "excerpt": "",
    "synopsis": "<p>This unique collection dramatizes the history of the modern American prison and offers a harrowing vision of prison life in America today. H. Bruce Franklin, a leading authority on American prison writing, has gathered more than sixty selections from some of the most powerful works - memoirs, stories, novels, poemswritten in the last hundred years.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Harrowing in their frank detail and desperate tone, the more than 60 selections in this anthology of writings about the prison experience in America pack an emotional wallop. According to Wicker's outspoken foreword, \"prisons and the violence and despair they symbolize... are a blot on American life and history.\" The U.S. penal system contains a population greater than that of New Hampshire, and even the pretense of rehabilitation was long ago subsumed by the need to punish. Beginning with accounts of the victims of Jim Crow and Black Code laws in the segregationist South and going through the contemporary journalism of Dannie Martin and Mumia Abu-Jamal, these views from behind the bars should be required reading for anyone concerned about the violence in our society and the high rate of recidivism. Franklin, in his introduction, argues that the institution of slavery has its modern counterpart in penal servitude While he sometimes seems stuck in the clichs of a New Left rhetoric, he has done a fine job of rediscovering the prison writers of the 1920s (a period of real flowering among convict writers, supported by H.L. Mencken's American Mercury magazine) like Jim Tully, Chester Himes and Ernie Booth. In this context, the more famous works of writers such as Nelson Algren, Malcolm X and Jack Henry Abbot, gain a fuller resonance. The book also highlights writers, like Piri Thomas, who are alive today but neglected. If the test of an anthology is whether it makes the reader want to pursue the works of the authors it presents, this provocative volume definitely qualifies. (June)</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                                        </h4>Harrowing in their frank detail and desperate tone, the more than 60 selections in this anthology of writings about the prison experience in America pack an emotional wallop. According to Wicker's outspoken foreword, \"prisons and the violence and despair they symbolize... are a blot on American life and history.\" The U.S. penal system contains a population greater than that of New Hampshire, and even the pretense of rehabilitation was long ago subsumed by the need to punish. Beginning with accounts of the victims of Jim Crow and Black Code laws in the segregationist South and going through the contemporary journalism of Dannie Martin and Mumia Abu-Jamal, these views from behind the bars should be required reading for anyone concerned about the violence in our society and the high rate of recidivism. Franklin, in his introduction, argues that the institution of slavery has its modern counterpart in penal servitude While he sometimes seems stuck in the clichs of a New Left rhetoric, he has done a fine job of rediscovering the prison writers of the 1920s (a period of real flowering among convict writers, supported by H.L. Mencken's American Mercury magazine) like Jim Tully, Chester Himes and Ernie Booth. In this context, the more famous works of writers such as Nelson Algren, Malcolm X and Jack Henry Abbot, gain a fuller resonance. The book also highlights writers, like Piri Thomas, who are alive today but neglected. If the test of an anthology is whether it makes the reader want to pursue the works of the authors it presents, this provocative volume definitely qualifies. (June)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Beverly\\ Gage</h4>I'd rather read one page by a man who had been in Hell than all of Dante,\" writer Jim Tully once intoned. If any single ideal necessitates an anthology like <i>Prison Writing in 20th-Century America</i>, it's this belief that personal experience inspires uniquely powerful literature. By their own accounts, each of the three dozen authors excerpted in this new collection has taken a trip to hell by way of prison -- and lived to write about it. Their vigorous and often surprising stories, essays and poems indict as well as humanize the taxpayer-funded underworld of the American criminal justice system.\n<p>As defined here by editor H. Bruce Franklin, the term \"prison writing\" includes anything written by a prisoner about prison -- often but not always written in prison. As Franklin notes in his introduction, this definition excludes much of what is written behind bars. O. Henry, for instance, wouldn't be considered a \"prison writer\" although he honed his skills at the Ohio State Penitentiary. On the whole, however, the anthology's criteria yield a remarkable variety of pieces from the famous once-incarcerated: Jack London, who spent a month behind bars for vagabondage; Robert Lowell, who did a year for resisting the World War II draft; Malcolm X, who got seven years for burglary; and Nelson Algren, who cooled his heels for a month after stealing a typewriter. The range, style and substance even among these four almost obscures the fact that they're all writing about the same basic institution. Lowell, for instance, offers a quietly beautiful account of the execution of a prisoner: \"Flabby, bald, lobotomized,/he drifted in a sheepish calm,/where no agonizing reappraisal/jarred his concentration on the electric chair.\" By contrast, Malcolm X polemicizes against prison's inhumanity: \"Any person who claims to have deep feeling for other human beings should think a long, long time before he votes to have other men kept behind bars -- caged.\"</p>\n<p>While the more famous authors generally live up to their reputations, much of the most creative and insightful writing in the collection can be found in the works of the less well-established. Iceberg Slim (Robert Beck) offers a scorchingly complex portrait of a newly politicized pimp who's trying to quit the life without angering his ex-whore: \"She didn't know I was determined not to join that contemptible group of aging pimps I had seen through the years and pitied as they went their pathetic way with a wild dream of new glory and a big fast stable of young freak mud kickers.\"</p>\n<p>Like Slim and many of the other authors in the anthology, Patricia McConnel explores the private fantasies that are the stuff of survival behind bars. In \"Sing Soft, Sing Loud,\" McConnel invokes a prisoner's dream of \"all them alkies and junkies and hookers and boosters raising the jailhouse roof with song ... Of course I know not even all of us singing at the top of our lungs woulda changed a goddam thing in that goddam jail, but it tickles me to think of it.\"</p>\n<p>For all of the importance of a collection like this, though, there's something disorienting about reading any single work as an example of \"prison writing.\" The label -- for better and for worse -- changes the work. Lowell's <i>Memories of West Street and Lepke</i> read in the context of a dozen Lowell poems, for instance, is an entirely different creature from that same poem read alongside other works on prison or on draft resistance. Similarly, <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> read as a prison work is different from <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> read as autobiography.</p>\n<p>On an individual level, it is a gross underestimation of these authors' talents to label them simply \"prison writers,\" subtly implying that their personal experience of prison is the most important aspect of their work. Yet the anthology itself is undeniably powerful. The combined eloquence of these authors evokes the eternal sameness and the vast diversity of prison experience as no single author could. As Tom Wicker points out in the book's foreword, prisons are meant \"to keep us out as well as them in.\" <i>Prison Writing in 20th-Century America</i> allows us all a chance to peer inside -- and to decide whether we like what we see. --<i>Salon</i> Sept. 1, 1998</p>\n\n\n</article>"

In an attempt \"to put together an archive of facts, a museum of American reality,\" he welcomed anyone to submit a story, following two rules: it must be true and it must be short. This book collects 179 stories-Auster calls them \"reports from the frontlines of personal experience\"-picked from over 4,000 entries. There is the unassuming yet beautiful portrait of a summer afternoon in a 1960s Manhattan neighborhood; the story of a man given leave after fifteen years in prison to attend his grandmother's funeral; and a homeless woman's account of her living situation. There are impossible coincidences, eerie omens and visions, and tales of love and war and family and death. <BR> Ted Waitt <BR> <BR></p>",

( Mar. 1) Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>KLIATT</h4>For anyone interested in reading about real America, this book offers glimpses of what life is like at the low end of the economic spectrum. Though most of the excerpts are fictional, they are fiction based strongly in the reality of life for America's poorest citizens, and they ring as true as the biographical writings. From young to old, these voices illuminate the shadowy lives of our most marginal citizens, and show to readers pictures that are disturbing to anyone with a heart. Through prose and poetry, we see through the eyes of poor Hispanic children living in rough places and rural Appalachian children whose lives are just as tough, and hear black voices who show us not only poverty but ignorance, prejudice, and injustice. We hear from adults who have triumphed over many obstacles to become successful adults; we also hear from and about those who have been overcome by the obstacles, and defeated by the injustices that society heaps on the poor. We are saddened by the young voices who express much despair and little hope and by the older voices who look back on troubled lives filled with unsuccessful attempts to overcome the stigma of being poor. We read about the unheard pleas of foster children, losing out to a system that doesn't work for them and is sometimes fatal to their humanity. There are Native American voices, white, black and Hispanic voices, and gay voices. There are male and female voices, old and young voices. It is historical and it is current. This collection will move the heart of anyone who reads it, for it shows just how much our society is failing a great number of our citizens. It is especially heart-wrenching to see what our children must endure. For students(and adults) who want to make a difference in the world and don't know where the problems are that need attention, this is an eye-opening book. For any readers who care about our society and our world, this is a must-read. Even though parts are fictional, this book should be part of every sociology class, social issues class, American history class, or current events class. This book provides an excellent portrait of a part of America that is often ignored. Category: Collections. KLIATT Codes: SA*—Exceptional book, recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2001, Norton, The New Press, 279p., , Mifflintown, PA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>VOYA</h4>This collection of short stories, essays, and poetry illustrates the daily struggle to survive faced by many Americans. Betty Smith, Sandra Cisneros, Ralph Ellison, and Mildred Taylor as well as the young, strong voices of Young Tay B2 and Danielle Joseph create a stirring and accurate portrayal of the trials the poor must endure in America. The term \"growing up\" accurately describes the works included in this book. Childhood is an innocent word that fails to describe the life of Francie in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, of Frank in The Optimists, or of Little Man in Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry. Francie learns that people talk about her in her presence without realizing that she can understand their insults. Frank sees his father kill a man with his bare hands. Little Man gets angry because the affluent white kids ride the school bus that intentionally splashes mud on the poorer kids every day as they walk to school. Poverty is often graphic, and so are these works. The editors not only attempt to describe children living in poverty, but they also offer the story of the strong personalities and successful people that have developed from it. Children of the ghetto who have succeeded are described as \"the few who make it out.\" This anthology makes the point that being poor can help a person succeed, not in spite of their difficulties but because of their difficulties. This fact is worth learning not only by those struggling with poverty but also by those who have distanced themselves from it.

The selections represent in part a \"who's who\" of 20th-century ethnic American writers, from Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Sandra Cisneros, Gary Soto, and Cathy Song. Lesser-known writers are also included. Sylvia Watanabe writes about growing up in the small villages around Maui's sugar plantations, and Andrew Lam writes from his own experiences as a Vietnamese refugee. Still other selections come from young people currently living in poverty in New York or behind bars in California detention centers. Short biographical sketches of the writers precede the selections and provide a framework for understanding their perspective. This is a powerful collection of experiences, insights, and emotions. Within these pages, the poor speak with a simplicity and eloquence that touch the soul. The book provides excellent selections to accompany American history and literature courses. In addition, the entries will provide powerful oral presentations as well as thought-provoking introductions to class discussions and debate.-Becky Ferrall, Stonewall Jackson High School, Manassas, VA Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>"

    "overview": "<br>\nAlthough we are used to thinking of science and the humanities as separate disciplines, in the nineteenth century this division was not recognized. As the scientist John Tyndall pointed out, not only were science and literature both striving to better \"man's estate\", they shared a common language and cultural heritage. The quest for \"origins\", the nature of the relationship between society and the individual, and what it meant to be human were subjects that occupied both the writing of scientists and novelists.\n<p>This anthology brings together a generous selection of scientific and literary material to explore the exchanges and interactions between them. Fed by a common imagination, scientists and creative writers alike used stories, imagery, style, and structure to convey their meaning, and to produce works of enduring power. It includes writing by Charles Babbage, Charles Darwin, Sir Humphry Davy, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Michael Faraday, Thomas Malthus, Louis Pasteur, Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, Mark Twain and many others. Also included are introductions and notes to guide the reader.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>\"The fierce and affecting memoir of a convicted murderer, whose growing self-awareness enables him to understand his crime and achieve redemption. In 1980, Kenneth Hartman murdered a homeless man in a Los Angeles park after a drug-fueled binge. Sentenced to life without parole by the state of California, Hartman was soon considered a potent force by the system's most brutal convicts. To the hellish chaos of a maximum-security prison he brought his own limitless propensity for violence - he often spent months at a time in solitary confinement, \"the Hole.\" \"After years in the cold embrace of the state prison system, Hartman discovered a vocation for writing; he also met, through a chance phone call, the woman he would marry and have a child by. With poignancy and self awareness, Hartman chronicles the anarchy and brutish moral code that rules in some of the world's most infamous prisons, where physical punishment is the only form of control. Over time, Hartman evolves into a sentient being; follows his newly discovered spiritual and literary inclinations; and learns to deal with his demanding responsibilities as a family man. The final chapter describes his development of the Honor Program, which helps motivated prisoners escape the ravages of incarceration.\" Mother California is the story of a man who did not succumb to the darkness of the only world left to him. It offers definite proof that there is no such thing as a life beyond redemption.</p>",

Hartman discovered his talent in a writing class, after having abandoned drugs; using it, he examines up close the \"mad, violent circus\" of prison life, his place in it, and the fate of his fellow prisoners: \"Under the big tent of this brutally unnatural environment, few of us ever take the frightening step of analyzing our deeper motives.\" <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "overview": "In this important new anthology, Venetria K. Patton and Maureen Honey bring together a comprehensive selection of texts from the Harlem Renaissance-a key period in the literary and cultural history of the United States. The collection revolutionizes our way of viewing this era, since it redresses the ongoing emphasis on the male writers of this time. Double-Take offers a unique, balanced collection of writers-men and women, gay and straight, familiar and obscure. Arranged by author, rather than by genre, this anthology includes works from major Harlem Renaissance figures as well as often-overlooked essayists, poets, dramatists, and artists. \n<p>The editors have included works from a wide variety of genres-poetry, short stories, drama, and essays-allowing readers to understand the true interdisciplinary quality of this cultural movement. Biographical sketches of the authors are provided and most of the pieces are included in their entirety. Double-Take also includes artwork and illustrations, many of which are from original journals and have never before been reprinted. Significantly, Double-Take is the first Harlem Renaissance title to include song lyrics to illustrate the interrelation of various art forms.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Arranged by author, 23 essays and 155 creative pieces represent the artistic and intellectual range of the Harlem Renaissance. Featuring the work of women and men in equal numbers, and including overlooked writers as well as the major figures of the period, the book assembles poetry, short stories, drama, essays, and song lyrics. Artwork and illustrations from periodicals of the time are also included. Essays discuss the history of Harlem, jazz, discrimination against African Americans, and sexism. Brief biographies precede the work of each writer. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>With this new anthology of Harlem Renaissance literature, Patton (Women in Chains: The Legacy of Slavery in Black Women's Fiction) and Honey (editor, Shadowed Dreams: Women's Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance), both at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, attempt to \"restore and underline the importance of women's writing\" and sexual orientation to the Harlem Renaissance. The balanced selection of women and men is similar to that found in Henry Louis Gates's Norton Anthology of African American Literature (LJ 2/01/97), but the inclusion of lesser-known figures and works is aimed at focusing on the ideology of the renaissance, gay and lesbian themes, and differences in gender-based issues. Countee Cullen, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston are among the authors represented, and the selected works include essays, poetry, prose, and drama, with lyrics and visual art used as illustration. The editors also break with the tendency to define the beginning and end of the renaissance with political events by focusing on specific literary works, which allows them to broaden the period to 1916-37. Both editors have done previous research in the field of African American women's literature and include a biographical sketch of each writer to underline how their gender, class, and sexual orientation shaped their work.

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>With this new anthology of Harlem Renaissance literature, Patton (Women in Chains: The Legacy of Slavery in Black Women's Fiction) and Honey (editor, Shadowed Dreams: Women's Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance), both at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, attempt to \"restore and underline the importance of women's writing\" and sexual orientation to the Harlem Renaissance. The balanced selection of women and men is similar to that found in Henry Louis Gates's Norton Anthology of African American Literature (LJ 2/01/97), but the inclusion of lesser-known figures and works is aimed at focusing on the ideology of the renaissance, gay and lesbian themes, and differences in gender-based issues. Countee Cullen, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston are among the authors represented, and the selected works include essays, poetry, prose, and drama, with lyrics and visual art used as illustration. The editors also break with the tendency to define the beginning and end of the renaissance with political events by focusing on specific literary works, which allows them to broaden the period to 1916-37. Both editors have done previous research in the field of African American women's literature and include a biographical sketch of each writer to underline how their gender, class, and sexual orientation shaped their work.

    "synopsis": "<p>Compiled to suggest what nineteenth-century America contributed to the history of poetry, rather than what poetry may contribute to a history of nineteenth-century America, this volume emphasizes those poets who have survived the Modernist revolution over those left behind. And so it is Whitman, Dickinson, and Melville who occupy the center of this anthology; these are the poets in whose ability to speak directly to our ears modern poetry has recognized its forebears. But only when these poetic innovators are read alongside the recognized giants of their day can we begin to see how truly extraordinary they are, and why they remained undervalued, unread, or altogether unknown in their own time. William C. Spengemann and Jessica F. Roberts have gathered nearly three hundred poems, spanning the course of the century: from Joel Barlow to Edwin Arlington Robinson, by way of Bryant, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, Poe, Holmes, Jones Very, Thoreau, Lowell, Lanier, and the largely forgotten Frederick Goddard Tuckerman and Sarah Morgan Piatt.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<b>NEW MEXICO'S MYSTERY STONE</b><br>\nDixie L. Perkins<br>\n<p class=\"null1\">The discovery of rune stones bearing inscriptions in early Scandinavian languages has long since cast doubt on the notion that Christopher Columbus was America's first tourist from Europe. Another inscribed stone, discovered in 1850 in the Rio Puerco Valley eighteen miles west of Los Lunas, New Mexico, makes the Norsemen, too, seem like latecomers. Long ago an inscription was chipped in a basalt outcrop in strange characters. Dixie L. Perkins, quoted here from her The Meaning of the New Mexico Mystery Stone, believes the inscription was the work of a Greek sailor about 500 B.C. who wrote: \"I have come up to this point . . . to stay. The other one met with an untimely death a year ago . . . I remain a hair of rabbit. I, Zakyneros . . . out of reach of mortal man, am fleeing and am very much afraid . . . I become hollow or gaunt from hunger.\"</p>\n<p>[A] significant communication was carved upon the Los Lunas, New Mexico, \"inscription rock\" or \"mystery stone.\"</p>\n<p>People were aware of the inscription when New Mexico became a territory in 1850, but no one could read it, However, one century later, Robert H. Pfeiffer of Harvard University, made the first known translation of the strange writing. He was considered to be an authority on the Old Testament; he concluded that the inscription was a copy of the Ten Commandments. He decided it was written in the Phoenician, the Moabite, and the Greek languages.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge, Professor Pfeiffer did not state, at the time, who he thought carved the message. However, his translation seemed to satisfy the curiosity of the people of that era. Indeed, it stoodfor many years as the final word. The stone is still referred to, occasionally, as the \"Ten Commandments rock.\"</p>\n<p>Further speculation involved the origin or the author of the inscription. Some viewers conjectured a member of one of the lost tribes of Israel, spoken of in the Bible, wrote it. In 1936, an anthropologist from the University of New Mexico, Dr. Frank C. Hibben, saw the rock. He expressed the view the writing could have been carved by the Mormons when they migrated westward ....</p>\n<p>In 1964, Robert H. LaFollette wrote an interesting translation of the inscription. As did Robert Pfeiffer in 1949, Mr. LaFollette determined some of the letters in the inscription were Phoenician. In addition, he concluded that other letters were in Hebrew, Cyrillic, and Etruscan. Thus, Robert LaFollette made the first attempt at a translation which would, in any way, challenge the established one of Robert Pfeiffer ....</p>\n<p>Zakyneros, the Greek, left the metropolitan Mediterranean area with its empires, armies and navies. Behind him were the seething cities and towns with attendant manufacturing, marketing, and trading industries.</p>\n<p>He arrived in the vast, relatively empty region of central New Mexico in 500 B.C. Blue, spruce-covered mountains stood apart in green grasslands. Lean red and purple mesas stretched themselves for many miles. From the north the great Rio Grande twisted to receive a watery contribution from the lesser Rio Puerco. Except for scattered ancient Indian tribes engaged in hunting, farming, and food-gathering pursuits, Zakyneros existed alone ....</p>\n<p>At any rate, he carved his story into pink-gray basalt. Geologists identify basalt as an igneous or lava-type rock. It varies in texture and in color, also, but the one Zakyneros wrote upon is very fine.</p>\n<p>The denseness of this particular rock made Zakyneros' self-assigned task more difficult. Possibly, he possessed bronze or iron tools. Archaeologists found several such European tools and weapons, too, in some of their digs in the United States.</p>\n<p>In whatever manner he did it, Zakyneros cut letters about .25 in. or .635 cm. deep into the basalt. The letters average 1.75 in. or 4.45 cm. high, and 1.50 in. or 3.81 cm. wide. The great depth of his letters indicates an ancient inscription. Despite some weathering, it has been preserved in excellent condition ....</p>\n<p>The size of the rock's writing surface measures 4.50 ft. or 1.37 m. wide, by 3.33 ft. or 1.02 m. high.</p>\n<p>The inscription rock is located on the lower right side of a large mound of lava. The lava mound lies in a little canyon. The canyon dents the base of a small, extinct volcanic mountain. Its altitude is 5,500 ft.</p>\n<p>The mountain is, appropriately, named Hidden Mountain on a present-day geological survey map. Scientifically, the area is known as the Lucero Basin, on the western edge of the Rio Grande trough. Hidden Mountain and the adjacent basaltic rocks, including the one on which Zakyneros carved, were formed only 20,000 years ago. The Lucero Uplift and the Puerco Fault Zone come together nearby.</p>\n<p>Located approximately in the middle of New Mexico, Hidden Mountain rises eighteen miles west of the city of Los Lunas. The mountain stand on privately owned ranch land in the desert, a mile south of New Mexico Highway 6. <i>Best of the West</i>. Copyright © by Tony Hillerman.

    "overview": "<p>Before Jack Kerouac expressed the spirit of a generation in his 1957 classic, <b>On the Road</b>, he spent years figuring out how he wanted to live and, above all, learning how to write. <b>Atop an Underwood</b> brings together more than sixty previously unpublished works that Kerouac wrote before he was twenty-two, ranging from stories and poems to plays and parts of novels, including an excerpt from his 1943 merchant marine novel, <b>The Sea Is My Brother</b>. These writings reveal what Kerouac was thinking, doing, and dreaming during his formative years, and reflect his primary literary influences. Readers will also find in these works the source of Kerouac's spontaneous prose style.</p>\n<p>Uncovering a fascinating missing link in Kerouac's development as a writer, Atop an Underwood is essential reading for Kerouac fans, scholars, and critics.</p>",

He was seeking work as a script synopsizer in the motion picture industry, believing that the experience would help him write his own scripts and establish contacts in the movie business. Parts Two and Three of this book open with subsequent passages from Kerouac's short autobiography.</i></blockquote>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>I was born in Lowell, Mass., in March of 1922. Shortly before my birth my father had begun a small theatrical publication known as the \"Spotlight Print,\" a unique weekly filled with news, comments, anecdotes, editorials, and advertisements dealing with the theatre and cinema of that time around Lowell and Boston. At the age of eleven, I spent most of my time after school in my father's printing and editorial offices, dashing off publications of my own on the antique typewriter, using the hand press for headlines and cuts. This early association with the printing and publishing business soon enough stained not only my blood but my hands and face with ink. My father's incessant stories about playing poker with George Arliss, with the Marx Brothers, with John Barrymore, and many other \"troopers\" during his days as an advertising man for the RKO Keith circuit in New England filled me with an early dream of the theatre.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At twelve, I printed a novel laboriously into a nickle notebook dealing with the adventures of a runaway orphan down the Merrimack River. At thirteen, I was busy turning out cartoon strips, handprinted racingform sheets, and a club newspaper. It was also at this time that the Lowell Sun published a \"column\" of mine written in father's office predicting the outcome of the Louis-Braddock fight to the round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year later, I was in High School trying out for the football team. A senior at sixteen, I had by that time so distinguished myself in athletics and studies to draw the attention of several colleges and football coaches for a scholarship, chief among them being Lou Little of Columbia and Frank Leahy, then Head Coach at Boston College. I chose Columbia, but since I needed more math before I could enroll there, Little arranged to send me to Horace Mann School here in New York, where, during the course of the year, Frank Leahy paid me a visit and tried to persuade me to go back to Boston College. He told me then, in 1940, that he might eventually leave B.C. for Notre Dame, but that he would take me to South Bend with him. \"Now,\" he said, \"let's go out and dine and see a good show. What would you like to see?\" \"William Saroyan!\" I cried.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to see \"Love's Old Sweet Song,\" and Frank seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. But, for my part, the performance was marred by the presence of a certain gentleman behind Leahy and me, and to this day I cannot tell whether or not it was a coincidence, or that the gentleman in the back row, the Freshman football coach at Columbia University, was surreptitiously tailing us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, I stuck to Columbia: New York was too exciting to leave, and was too closely identified with boyhood dreams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Horace Mann, I was an out-and-out killer: star on the football, baseball, and chess teams, I earned money writing sports news for the New York World-Telegram (a job I got through Lou Miller, scholastic sports editor), turning out English papers for lazy but wealthy fellow students, and tutoring French. I wrote feature articles for the school weekly (mostly interviews, one with Glenn Miller), took an active part in the Dramatic Club, wrote several articles on jazz, which earned me the title of \"jazz critic,\" appeared each quarter in the Horace Mann Quarterly with a short story, and, although I played baseball and football on the teams, wrote up the games, and often my own successes, the following day. In general, I earned good enough marks and made a sufficient impression to rate the status of \"good citizen\" from the prim, severe Dean. (However, at graduation exercises, finding myself the only member of the class sans culottes blanches—the irony of economic determinism—I spent the afternoon reclining under a tree behind the school thinking about Whitman and Saroyan, whom I had just begun to admire.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At home in Lowell that summer, two old pals and I made elaborate preparations to stage a three-act play in a small town in the outlying suburbs. I wrote the script, the other was to take the leading role, and the third undertook a producer's duties. In the end, our mutual money shortage made short shrift of our attempts, but we did manage to put on a 15-minute play over the local radio station. These pitiful efforts may sound ludicrous to an outsider, but I cannot forget the enthusiasm with which we pitched our projects; nor can I forget the morning we three went to the old swimming hole in the pine woods to see the sunrise, after a long night of discussion, planning, writing, and drinking of coffee. For, later on, the \"producer\" was at Bataan, the \"actor\" is at present in Italy with the Fifth Army, and the \"writer\" spent many long, cold months in the North Atlantic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Fall, at Columbia, I returned a kickoff against Princeton Frosh 85 yards to the Princeton 5-yard line and was carried off the field with a broken leg. I was actually glad; now I would have all of my time to myself and for studies. I wrote movie reviews for the Columbia Spectator, covered the varsity track team in the winter; ran a one-man typing agency, did some more ghost-writing, was elected Vice-President of the class, tutored French, and worked as private secretary for Prof. Eugene Sheffer of the French department. I helped Prof. Sheffer edit and translate his French textbook, typed out the whole manuscript, and even ventured definitions for his daily Journal-American crossword puzzle. We became fast friends; I wrote voluminously and took all my plays and stories to him. At this time, I had begun to read Thomas Wolfe and would spend entire nights roaming New York until dawn. I wrote and wrote, sending stories to all the better magazines (New Yorker, Esquire, Harper's, etc.), but without success [....]</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>Repulsion May Race Here in<br>\n Exhibition Feature!!

E. R. Bradley Brings out Six of his 3-yr. old Maidens; Lewis, Morriss, Myet at Track; Kerouac, Tortar Barns Present!\" Between 1936 and 1938 Kerouac produced an amazing array of sports news publications filled with reports on real-world and make-believe sporting events and characters. Among these \"newspapers\" were</i> Romper's Sheet, Sports: Down Pat, Racing News, <i>the</i> Sportsman, Turf Authority, Jack Lewis's 1937 Chatterturf, <i>the</i> Daily Ball, Sports of Today, Jack Lewis's Baseball Chatter, <i>and the</i> Daily Owl. <i>The publications were either carefully printed in pencil or typed as single-spaced sheets (without errors). In them we see the teenaged Kerouac as sports reporter, columnist, and statistician, consumed with the texture of the different contests and colorful personalities. His peppy writing style and intricate records lift these early efforts beyond the hobby-time doodling of a typical boy. Interestingly, some of the publications are long, densely typed sheets filled top to bottom like later manuscripts Kerouac produced.</i></blockquote>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Pawtucket Park, Montpelier, Vt.:—Repulsion, mighty son of Khorasan, 1936 Champion candidate, is expected to stop here on his way to Sarah Springs for the distinguished Spring meet and Preakness. Don Pablo, great gigantic 1935 King, may also stop here and Jock Dennis hopes it will be in time for Repulsion's race. This match would attract at least 16,000 race goers, figures the little owner of Pawtucket.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down at Sarah Springs, the colorful scene of fair ladies and rich gentlemen, flying banners and of course the historical Derby, Spotlight and yearly Preakness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These three stakes may compare with the Vermont Derby. Although the class is lacking for that race, it is going to be a historical feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even last year, men were chatting about this time (in February) about the Massachusetts Derby. Well may they talk about the Vermont. Repulsion, widely known as the fastest runner ever put out since racing history began, will attract many. Ranking as the world's champion, Repulsion should win the small race in which he will race in here but Don Pablo may be on hand, but yet the latter has had a serious leg injury.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, E. R. Bradley's highly touted Lena Cardoza will start in the Pawtucket Hi-Stakes with Onrush, Brevity, Sisowen and other stars. Rustic Joe, Mac Tortar's entry for that race and Boake Dobbin's Blue John are the old boys that will start. Blue John, a clever veteran campaigner can easily beat the field of ten. Rhodius, Mac Tortar's sensational three yr. old that improves with every start, is making his first start since racing in the Hopeful in December. Boake Dobbin's Brevity, another highly touted colt, also will have something to say.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>from Football Novella</b></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote><i>The following excerpt carries familiar Kerouac motifs: American road voyager, wayward collegian, and football hero. Kerouac sent the manuscript of this novella (written when he was sixteen years old) to a reader with a note addressed \"Dear Margaret,\" most likely Margaret Wiley, one of the professors of his friend Sebastian Sampas at Emerson College in Boston. Kerouac explained to Margaret that he stopped writing just before the undefeated State U. team was about to face State College in the climactic Thanksgiving Day game. He then attached to the novella sixteen pages from another story, with the character name changes scratched in, and outlined the climax on another sheet. At this point in the story the coach had moved the main character, Bill Clancy, to a running back position:</i></blockquote>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>With a great bull-like, madly determined, tormented run Bill Clancy charges down the field with tears of fury in his eyes. He just doesn't want to be stopped. They hit him several times; he shakes them off. One Trojan tackler gets him by the neck and becomes momentarily his streamer and banner, and drops off. Big State linemen, particularly Bill's friend George Baker, throw great body-blocks that clear Bill's path, and he makes it down to the goal-line by crashing over with four men (two from each team), on him and in front of him: they all fall over the goal-line. Touchdown ... State 12, Trojans 7. The run characterizes Bill's general determination throughout the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Harrison McCoy himself is so moved that he makes up with Bill in the lockers, so that after the game, amid wild celebration of a great hard victory (as distinguished from all the easy victories heretofore), McCoy himself suggests Bill &amp; Barbara join him and his new girl to the ball. The human solution is everyone forgetting grievances, and rival lovers finding themselves appropriate mates. Which is also the way Clancy wanted it ... because earlier he \"doesn't like to fight with anybody.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote><i>In a notebook entry from February 15, 1950, Kerouac described the emerging central figure for his novel On the Road as \"closer to Bill Clancy, the football-hero-hobo I wrote at sixteen; also closer to Wesley Martin of `The Sea is My Brother'</i> [....]\"</blockquote>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Old Chet Hingham was the first to see Bill Clancy. At least, he was the first member of the Brierville township to see him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a sultry August afternoon, and Old Chet was sitting at his usual post at the railroad crossing, reading the Brierville News. As he remembered it, he also had a copy of the State University Crier with him, which Scotty Cobb had just brought him that morning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Way up the tracks, Old Chet could see a tiny speck come crawling along. After a few minutes, he could make out the figure of a young man with a pack on his back, walking the rail like an expert. A few more minutes elapsed, and Old Chet could hear the tune of \"My Wild Irish Rose\" come drifting over the rails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, Old Chet had told the story later on, he didn't pay much attention to this bum. But when he had approached the crossing to such an extent that Old Chet could make out the sun-burnt, clean cut features shaded by an old felt hat.... Old Chet took an interest and put down his paper to study him as he passed by.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he didn't have a chance to do it quietly. The young fellow stopped and addressed Old Chet: \"How do you do. Could I possibly get a drink of water inside that box of yours?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What box?\" asked Old Chet, disturbed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Why that thing you live in, I suppose. It's right in back of you. Can't you see it?\" And he had the audacity to point out Old Chet's cherished railroad shack with his finger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Old Chet Hingham was pretty particular about his railroad crossing shack. It wasn't big, nor was it fancy.... but Old Chet had been working in front of that shack for twenty-eight years. And inside, it graced the finest gate-tending equipment in the county. Naturally, Old Chet fumed immediately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Look here, you scoundrel, what makes you think you have the right to call this shack of mine a `Box.' I ought to be several years younger; I'd teach you a lesson or two!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man had a charming smile, and when he turned it on, Old Chet Hingham couldn't help but like him a little bit despite his disparaging remarks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"If you want a drink of water, just wait outside here,\" Old Chet finally said. \"I'll get you some.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Thank you very much,\" the young man had said, the smile still creasing his bronzed face. \"I'll need it.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From inside, while he filled a quart bottle full of water, Old Chet called out: \"Where you from?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Nowheres,\" had been the calm answer. \"I'm just drifting along.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Chet came out with the bottle of water.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"You mean to say that you haven't even got a home!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Well, not exactly,\" said the younger, draining the bottle in record time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Well, where is your home?\" queried Old Chet suspiciously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I was born in Arkansas,\" answered the bedraggled youth. \"I left home a couple of years ago to go on my own hook.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What did your Paw say to that?\" asked Old Chet, sitting down on his stool in front of the shack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"He died before I was born, and my Maw died when I was five years old. Instead of sticking around with my aunt and my sisters, I figgered it would be better for them if I jest drifted off. Nobody even noticed it much.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Chet got to like the boy from then on. He was interested, and wanted to know more: \"What you been doin'?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Well,\" smiled the youngster, seating himself on the ground and leaning back on the shack, his eyes pointed to the sky. \"I've been drifting for four years now. Up in Vermont, I was cuttin' trees. When I passed through Virginia, I worked on a tobacco farm. I can remember the job I had on a wheat ranch in Kansas. I don't reckon it would be very interesting listening, all those four years. Except maybe one year.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What was that?\" asked Old Chet, carefully studying the youngster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter took out an old corn-cob pipe and began to fill it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Believe it or not,\" he went on, \"I went to College.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"You don't say!\" ejaculated Old Chet. \"Why, we have a college right here in Brierville. State University.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Have you? Well, this college I went to was out in the Middle West. One day I was throwin' rocks over the river, I forget which one. A whole day I had been standin' near the highway, tryin' to get a ride. Well, I took a little rest and got throwin' rocks for the exercise. A man in a nice coupe stopped and watched me for a while. When I turned around, he offered me a ride. The next day, I was all set for College. He was the baseball coach out there, and he said I had the best throwing arm he had ever seen. I played centerfield in the Spring on the team, and got sick of college in June. I stuck it out till the Freshman year was over, and I took to the road again. I wonder what Coach Billings must of thought of me!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"And you didn't like college?\" asked Old Chet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"No, not much. I stuck it out for a whole year, and then I hit the road. I travel by hitchhiking and hopping freights.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Must be sort of exciting.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Well,\" said Bill Clancy, puffing his corn-cob pipe. \"I figger I'll stick to drifting until I feel like settling down on a permanent job.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"How on earth,\" asked Old Chet, \"do you manage to eat three meals a day?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Sometimes I stop in on a town and wash dishes in a restaurant for a couple of days or so. I get myself up enough money to eat for a few weeks, and leave. I don't like to stay in the same place long.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the tracks, the 2:57 was coming, heralded by a long mournful wail which traveled over the rails toward the two men at the crossing. Old Chet got up leisurely and went to work on the controls. The two long poles, striped black and white, dropped down parallel to the rails. For the first time, young Bill Clancy glanced about him and inspected Brierville. The train roared louder and louder until it thundered across the crossing, throwing a wind which knocked Bill's felt hat from his head.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it had disappeared around the bend, Bill got up with his pack in his hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Thanks a lot for the drink, Mister,\" he had said. \"Now, if you could tell me where the restaurant is around here, I think I could stand a few days of this little burgh....\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Just down the street,\" said Old Chet, smiling for the first time. \"Good luck to ye!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The same to you,\" shot back Bill. According to Old Chet, Bill Clancy had crossed the tracks and headed into the center of Brierville lustily whistling \"My Wild Irish Rose.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I swear,\" Old Chet had said. \"That kid is going to do something big right here in Brierville. I have a feeling he will....\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Chet swore he'd said that, that very same sultry afternoon. [...]</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>CHAPTER SEVEN</b></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>The day of the Blaine game had arrived. Thousands of cars, down for the game from the big industrial towns up north, were milling about the streets of little Brierville.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blaine College, a set-up for the big State juggernaut, had arrived the night before after a trip of 400 miles. The team had stayed at the inn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nesmith Stadium was the scene of excitement. Just before game time, with the gridiron all spick and span, white lines and goal posts intact, the bands began to blare and the crowd began to arrive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When State's brilliant blue and white colors came out on the field, worn by two dozen husky football players, the roar went up from the stands. The cavernous maw which had enveloped the players in practice now seemed to be turbulent with life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The starting lineup began to run through their paces, a short signal drill. Then the backs began to punt and pass, and the linemen running about. Bill Clancy, who was to start at right guard, was thoroughly awed by the vastness of the big football scene. His roommate, Manny Martin, ran beside him at right tackle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Wassamatter, Bill? Excited, nervous?\" said the rangy tackle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I dunno,\" muttered Bill, running his stubby hand through his brown hair. \"It sure is a big crowd.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Wait till the rest of it arrives. As a matter of fact, wait till the big game of the year on Thanksgiving Day!\" replied Martin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Who's the team then?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin said with a very suggestive expression: \"State College!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coach Bob Alexander and Assistant Coach Joe Neal stood nearby, watching their charges dash about. The other team, Blaine, had now come out on the field. The stands continued to fill up, until Bill thought they would burst with corpulence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Clancy, however, had little to worry about. Barbara Barnard and he had been seeing plenty of each other in the past week, after that first official meeting at the Town Hall dance. Bill could still remember the dances with her, and the walk home, and the joking about their first meeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when Bill had met Barbara on the campus, she had greeted him warily. Harrison McCoy, originally known as her beau, had now stepped into the background in favor. And this was known all over the University.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the enmity between Bill Clancy and Harrison McCoy—both of them strong candidates for All-America—had become a real feud. Both of them were angling for the same girl—and both of them had disliked each other at the first meeting. The natural result was a seething hatred on the part of McCoy, an uncomfortable dislike on the part of Bill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the game was almost ready to begin. George Baker, who had been elected captain of the varsity eleven just a few days previous, was towering over the officials and the Blaine captain out in the middle of the field. A team which has a hugely proportioned captain like George Baker always has a psychological edge over the other team. The coin was tossed, and State was to receive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coach Alexander got the team lined up and sent them through a final short signal drill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment Bob Alexander's State eleven began to run through their plays, newspapermen in the stands immediately sensed the odor of champs. The pressbox was afire with excitement. The radio hookup man was excitedly jabbering away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What may prove to be the year's finest football eleven in college ranks can be seen down on the field this fine afternoon, running through its paces like a perfectly geared machine.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The backfield, composed of Felix Henderson at the quarter, who had now forgotten the first day of Bill Clancy's football career and had become one of Bill's finest friends; Harrison McCoy, the highly heralded halfback; Ben Barnouw, the passing ace; and Lou Ginelli, the big Italian fullback line-plunger, was called in by Coach Alexander for a final word. The linemen then received their instructions, after which the entire eleven joined hands before going out on the field to receive the kickoff from Blaine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbara Barnard was seated up in the stands with her father, Professor Barnard, and with Scotty Cobb. She and Scotty had become inseparable, although hardly in an amorous way. Among other in the vast crowd were Big Gertie, Old Chet Hingham, and the faculty of the University. Almost everybody in Brierville was in the stands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the kickoff. The ball, gyrating end-over-end, came down on State ten yard line, where Big Lou Ginelli picked it up. He returned it to the forty-seven yard line, plunging straight ahead, with the State team blocking beautifully. And so the State football season had begun.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the play, Bill Clancy had had a huge lump in his throat just before the kickoff. As soon as he had seen the ball go sailing over his head and beyond him to the State backs, he had sorted out a Blaine man to take out. And this he did. He hit him head on, flattening the unsuspecting Blaine player out on the green, and falling on top of him to hold him intact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game was on. The highly vaunted State University team was ready to show whether or not it was the mighty team it has been predicted to be, even against the weak Blaine eleven.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first play, Harrison McCoy was in the tailback. But the ball was snapped to a short back, Ginelli, and the latter plowed into the Blaine line like an elephant through the jungle grass. He made six yards before crumpling underneath the weight of four men.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second down and four to go.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team came out of its huddle and snapped into its formation with a fancy dancelike step. The glistening white helmets flashed in the September sun. The blue jerseys, with large white numbers and white stripes on the sleeves, lined up in a perfectly geometrically formation. The Bob Alexander shift had a beauty and grace about it that made the team look like a million bucks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brown ball, brand new and just beginning to pick up a little dirt, went spinning back to Harrison McCoy. The guard, Bill Clancy, pulled out. The right side of the line cross-blocked as Bill pulled out, accompanied by Ginelli and Barnouw. The three of them darted toward the Blaine left end, bowled him over, and went on to the close back. Behind this steam-roller blocking pranced Harrison McCoy, his long powerful legs cutting up the gridiron. He swept around the fallen end, past the bewildered close back, and down the sidelines. Right ahead of him ran Bill Clancy. Now, McCoy was on his own, and had already gained 12 yards. He went down the sidelines until almost pushed out of bounds by two pursuing Blaine backs, whence he cut back suddenly and flanked toward the left. One of the Blaine linemen dove frantically and hung on to McCoy's foot. McCoy stumbled forward, and finally crashed to the ground. Otherwise, he would have scored a touchdown; the field ahead of him had been clear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ball was now on the Blaine 30, First down, and ten yards to go. State again came out of its huddle, and went into their graceful shift. The ball went back to Ben Barnouw, who began to sweep the end. It was the identical play which the varsity had tried out that first day in practice, and which had resulted in a sixty-four yard jaunt on the part of McCoy. Barnouw suddenly faded from his end run, flipped a neat pass to quarterback Henderson, who in turn lateraled to McCoy. The latter had a clear field down the sidelines, and as he dashed down in a straight line, the lane began to narrow with potential tacklers, but the time McCoy had reached the 18 yard line, he was confronted by four Blaine men. With a lightning cut, McCoy veered to the left and flanked the men, heading for the goal-line in a long diagonal sprint. He reached it with plenty to spare, going over standing up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State 6, Blaine 0 ... and the game was hardly two minutes old.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felix Henderson converted the point, making the score 7-0 in favor of State U.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd went berserk, and the newspapermen began to typewrite wildly. The radio announcer began to take on an \"I told you so\" air. Truly, the vaunted greatness of State University had been no exaggeration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The afternoon went on, and the gridiron was dug and marred and mauled by the scuffling elevens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sun was going down in the West, and the football fans all had that tired, happy look in their faces; when the stands were painted by the russet glow of sunset—the score was immense!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State—54 Blaine—0. And through the keen air of the evening sunset, there was the blast of a gun, ending the game. Seven touchdowns! Seven successful conversions by the drop-kicking Felix Henderson. And out of the seven touchdowns, five were chalked up by the Galloping Ghost of the new season, Harrison McCoy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the chilly locker rooms, Bill Clancy shivered as he hauled off his sticky uniform. His body gave out steam, his feet were cold. His ribs ached with exhaustion, and his head felt hot and stuffy. Under the hot shower, Bill let out a long sigh of relief; the prickly sensation of the water sent waves of comfortable blood through his wiry frame.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milling fans filled the locker rooms, talking, gesticulating, watching the State heroes. Bill Clancy paid little attention to them, and turned on the cold water. The invigorating effect made him yelp, and he darted from the showers to his locker where he dried himself vigorously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All dressed and with the hair slicked, Bill Clancy began to feel like a human being again. As he was fixing his tie, he nodded and smiled at the people who were surrounding him and talking all at once. He could make nothing out of it, and let them talk on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What tackles you made today, Clancy!\" an old grad was saying. \"You almost killed the entire Blaine backfield!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Thanks,\" Bill mumbled, picking up his canvas bag and hanging it in the locker.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"You were terrific!\" piped someone else.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Thank you,\" smiled Bill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, the sun had gone down and the stadium was literally empty, except for the scattered remains of enthusiastic fans. Bill shuddered as a cold Autumnal blast came down the mussed up gridiron and hit him in the face. There were cuts and bumps here and there on his face, and his shoulders ached. All in all, as Bill walked along toward his dormitory room, he felt somewhat weary, but happy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was to be a victory dance in the evening, and Bill could think of nothing but meeting Barbara there. Wearing a topcoat and felt hat, Bill strode along through the falling leaves and reached the dorm. A big yellow Fall moon was beginning to peep over the little houses of Brierville.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Bill was about to enter into the hallway of his dorm, he noticed a figure approaching him from the sidewalk. Bill waited, until he could make out the tall graceful form of Harrison McCoy. [...]</p>",

    "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Chicago Tribune</h4><i>Atop an Underwood</i> is indispensable for the reader who wants to chart the development of one of our talented writers.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                            </h4>\"I am part of the American temper, the American temperament, the American tempo,\" writes a teenage Kerouac in a prophetic 1941 prose fragment, one of the 60 such pieces in this collection of Kerouac's juvenilia. These fugitive pieces, previously unpublished, provide a tantalizing glimpse of the future Beat generation originator, spanning Kerouac's adolescence and his first years in New York. The themes here would later find expression in On the Road and the Duluoz series: his French-American heritage, with its idiosyncratic English; his mystical identification with America; and, taking cues from Whitman, his vision of art as a means to unfold the authenticity of the self. The best pieces are the short sketches written in Hartford in 1941. Kerouac crafts, diary-style, a catalogue of daily activities (working in a cookie factory, living in a cheap apartment) while experimenting with the rhythms and forms he derived from his reading of Thomas Wolfe and William Saroyan. In the early '40s, Kerouac lived in several diverse social spheres. He worked in Hartford, attended Columbia University on a football scholarship, was kicked out of Columbia, enlisted in the Merchant Marines and simply bummed around. It is evident that radio had an overlooked influence on Kerouac's style. A piece like \"Howdy,\" which begins, \"Howdy. This is Jack Kerouac, speaking to you,\" obviously takes its formal cues from radio broadcasts. The last section of the book is less interesting, excerpting a section of a novel Kerouac wrote about the Merchant Marines. Although this book shouldn't be a starting place for new Kerouac readers, there is enough real Kerouac bebop here to interest even his more casual fans. (Nov.) FYI: The publication of this collection will coincide with the publication of the second volume of Kerouac's selected letters.

Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Kerouac's early writings—from ages 13 to 21—elucidate the formative years and provide insight into the later literature of the author's career. It must be noted that even the greatest writers aren't always recognizable by their high school and college scribblings. Poet Marion assembles a motley medley of Kerouac's initial attempts, including his adolescent horse worship in \"Repulsion May Race Here in Exhibition Feature!!,\" excerpts from a football novella, and descriptive essays about his youth. Such pieces may be significant to the scholar tracking Kerouac's artistic development and to his rabid fans (Kerouac's following is often a zealous one), but they hold little value or interest to the general reader. The anthology bogs down with the author's high school jazz criticism, sketches of a play he thought of writing, descriptions of his dreams, and poems in which he attempts to channel Walt Whitman's ghost into his own pen. Though such writings provide a general background to Kerouac's life and demonstrate his early interest in such themes as American life, travel, identity, and spiritual quests, they rarely stand as compelling works on their own. Also, many of the pieces are mere fragments, snippets of subject matter that caught his attention and that, for some reason or another, he never completed. The poetry of the collection fares slightly better, yet it suffers often from a jejune combination of Whitman-like rhetoric with slushy sentimentalism. A curmudgeon might say that, with rare exceptions, teenagers aren't old or experienced enough to create much of real artistic value; Kerouac's early efforts would fit such a maxim.\n\n</article>"

The result is a vibrant smorgasbord.... <i>[Best New Poets]</i> bears evidence of the insistent inquiries of self and the world that drive poetry.</p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>BookPleasures</h4><p>[One] comes to realize that the adjectives ‘new’ and ‘emerging’ are mere technicalities in this instance. Although none of the poets included here have published a full-length book of poetry, many are MFA students or graduates, and chapbook authors, and most have already seen some of their poems published in the most renowned and exclusive journals in North America....

Renowned poet Heather McHugh loves words and the unexpected places they take you; her own poetry elevates wordplay to a species of metaphysical wit. For this year's anthology McHugh has culled a spectacular group of poems reflecting her passion for language, her acumen, and her vivacious humor.</p>\n<p>From the thousands of poems published or posted in one year, McHugh has chosen seventy-five that fully engage the reader while illustrating the formal and tonal diversity of American poetry. With new work by established poets such as Louise Glück, Robert Hass, and Richard Wilbur, The Best American Poetry 2007 also features such younger talents as Ben Lerner, Meghan O'Rourke, Brian Turner, and Matthea Harvey.</p>\n<p>Graced with McHugh's fascinating introduction, the anthology includes the ever-popular notes and comments section in which the contributors write about their work. Series editor David Lehman's engaging foreword limns the necessity of poetry. <i>The Best American Poetry 2007</i> is an exciting addition to a series committed to covering the American poetry scene and delivering great poems to a broad audience.</p>",
    "excerpt": "<br>\nFOREWORD\n<p><i>by David Lehman</i></p>\n<br>\n<p>A parody, even a merciless one, is not necessarily an act of disrespect. Far from it. Poets parody other poets for the same reason they write poems in imitation (or opposition): as a way of engaging with a distinctive manner or voice. A really worthy parody is implicitly an act of homage.</p>\n<p>Some great poets invite parody. Wordsworth's \"Resolution and Independence\" prompted Lewis Carroll to pen \"The White Knight's Song\" in <i>Through the Looking Glass.</i> In a wonderful poem, J. K. Stephen alludes to the sestet of a famous Wordsworth sonnet (\"The world is too much with us\") to dramatize the wide discrepancy between Wordsworth at his best and worst. \"At certain times / Forth from the heart of thy melodious rhymes, / The form and pressure of high thoughts will burst,\" Stephen writes. \"At other times -- good Lord! I'd rather be / Quite unacquainted with the ABC / Than write such hopeless rubbish as thy worst.\"</p>\n<p>Among the moderns, T. S. Eliot reliably triggers off the parodist. Wendy Cope brilliantly reduced <i>The Waste Land</i> to five limericks (\"The Thames runs, bones rattle, rats creep; / Tiresias fancies a peep -- / A typist is laid, / A record is played -- / Wei la la. After this it gets deep\") while Eliot's late sententious manner stands behind Henry Reed's \"Chard Whitlow\" with its throat-clearing assertions (\"As we get older we do not get any younger\"). In a recent (2006) episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> on television, Lisa Simpson assembles a poem out of torn-up fragments, and attributes it to Moe the bartender. The title: \"Howling at a Concrete Moon.\" The inspiration: <i>The Waste Land.</i> The cigar-chewing editor of <i>American Poetry Perspectives</i> barks into the phone, \"Genius. Pay him nothing and put him on the cover.\"</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the most parodied of all poems is Matthew Arnold's \"Dover Beach,\" which has long served graduation speakers and Polonius-wannabes as a touchstone. Arnold turned forty-five in 1867, the year the poem first appeared in print. Here it is:</p>\n<blockquote>DOVER BEACH \n<p>The sea is calm to-night.</p>\n<p>The tide is full, the moon lies fair</p>\n<p>Upon the straits; -- on the French coast the light</p>\n<p>Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,</p>\n<p>Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.</p>\n<p>Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!</p>\n<p>Only, from the long line of spray</p>\n<p>Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,</p>\n<p>Listen! you hear the grating roar</p>\n<p>Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,</p>\n<p>At their return, up the high strand,</p>\n<p>Begin, and cease, and then again begin,</p>\n<p>With tremulous cadence slow, and bring</p>\n<p>The eternal note of sadness in.</p>\n<p>Sophocles long ago</p>\n<p>Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought</p>\n<p>Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow</p>\n<p>Of human misery; we</p>\n<p>Find also in the sound a thought,</p>\n<p>Hearing it by this distant northern sea.</p>\n<p>The Sea of Faith</p>\n<p>Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore</p>\n<p>Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.</p>\n<p>But now I only hear</p>\n<p>Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,</p>\n<p>Retreating, to the breath</p>\n<p>Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear</p>\n<p>And naked shingles of the world.</p>\n<p>Ah, love, let us be true</p>\n<p>To one another! for the world, which seems</p>\n<p>To lie before us like a land of dreams,</p>\n<p>So various, so beautiful, so new,</p>\n<p>Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,</p>\n<p>Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;</p>\n<p>And we are here as on a darkling plain</p>\n<p>Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,</p>\n<p>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The greatness of this poem lies in the way it transforms the painting of a scene into a vision of \"eternal sadness\" and imminent danger. Moonlight and the English Channel contemplated from atop the white cliffs of Dover by a man and woman in love would seem a moment for high romance, and a reaffirmation of vows as a prelude to sensual pleasure. But \"Dover Beach,\" while remaining a love poem, is not about the couple so much as it is about a crisis in faith and a foreboding of dreadful things to come. It communicates the anxiety of an age in which scientific hypotheses, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, combined with philosophical skepticism to throw into doubt the comforting belief in an all-knowing and presumably benevolent deity. The magnificent closing peroration, as spoken by the poet to his beloved, has the quality of a prophecy darkly fulfilled. Genocidal violence, perpetrated by \"ignorant armies,\" marked the last century, and it is undeniable that we today face a continuing crisis in faith and confidence. Seldom have our chief institutions of church and state seemed as vulnerable as they do today with, on the one side, a citizenry that seems alienated to the extent that it is educated, and on the other side, enemies as implacable and intolerant as they are medieval and reactionary.</p>\n<p>Though traditional in its means, \"Dover Beach\" is, in its spirit and its burden of sense, a brutally modern poem, and among the first to be thus designated. \"Arnold showed an awareness of the emotional conditions of modern life which far exceeds that of any other poet of his time,\" Lionel Trilling observed. \"He spoke with great explicitness and directness of the alienation, isolation, and excess of consciousness leading to doubt which are, as so much of later literature testifies, the lot of modern man.\" And Trilling goes on to note that in \"Dover Beach\" in particular the diction is perfect and the verse moves \"in a delicate crescendo of lyricism\" to the \"great grim simile\" that lends the poem's conclusion its desperation and its pathos.</p>\n<p>While perfect for the right occasion, a recitation of the poem is, because of its solemnity, absurd in most circumstances, as when, in the 2001 movie <i>The Anniversary Party,</i> the Kevin Kline character recites the closing lines from memory in lieu of an expected lighthearted toast, and the faces of the other characters change from pleasure to confusion and alarm. Inspired responses to \"Dover Beach\" spring to mind. In \"The Dover Bitch,\" Anthony Hecht presents the situation of Arnold's poem from the woman's point of view. She rather resents being treated \"as a sort of mournful cosmic last resort,\" brought all the way from London for a honeymoon and receiving a sermon instead of an embrace. Tom Clark lampoons \"Dover Beach\" more farcically. His poem begins as Arnold's does, but where in the third line of the original \"the French coast\" gleams in the distance, in Clark's poem light syrup drips on \"the French toast,\" and the poem continues in the spirit of \"crashing ignorance.\" A third example is John Brehm's \"Sea of Faith,\" which Robert Bly selected for the 1999 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry.</i> Here a college student wonders whether the body of water named in the poem's title exists in geographical fact. The student's ignorance seems to confirm Arnold's gloomy vision, but it also spurs the instructor to a more generous response. After all, who has not felt the unspoken wish for an allegorical sea in which one can swim and reemerge \"able to believe in everything, faithful / and unafraid to ask even the simplest of questions, / happy to have them simply answered\"?</p>\n<p>Poets like to parody \"Dover Beach\" because the poem takes itself so very seriously and because Arnold's wording sticks in the mind. But not everyone agrees on what lesson we should draw from this case. The poet Edward Dorn, author of <i>Gunslinger</i> and other estimable works, called \"Dover Beach\" the \"greatest single poem ever written in the English language.\" What amazed Dorn was that it should be Arnold who wrote it. According to Dorn, Arnold \"wrote volume after volume of lousy, awful poetry.\" The anomaly \"proves that you should never give up,\" Dorn added. If Arnold with his \"pedestrian mind\" could write \"Dover Beach,\" then \"anybody could do it.\"</p>\n<p>I have dwelled on \"Dover Beach\" as an object of irreverence not only because the parodic impulse, which informs so many contemporary poems (including some in this volume), is misunderstood and sometimes unfairly derogated, but also because of a superb counterexample that came to my attention this year. In his novel <i>Saturday</i> (2005), Ian McEwan makes earnest use of \"Dover Beach\" as a rich, unironic emblem of the values of Western Civilization. It is not the only such emblem in the book. There are <i>Bach's Goldberg Variations</i> and Samuel Barber's <i>Adagio for Strings,</i> to which the book's neurosurgeon hero listens when operating, and there is the surgeon's knife, the antithesis of the thug's switchblade. But a reading aloud of \"Dover Beach\" in the most extreme of circumstances marks the turning point in the plot of this novel whose subject is terror and terrorism.</p>\n<p>Set in London on a day of massive antiwar demonstrations, <i>Saturday</i> centers on a car accident that pits Henry, the surgeon, against Baxter, a local crime boss. Henry gets the better of Baxter in the confrontation, and in retaliation the gangster and a henchman mount an assault on the surgeon and his family in their posh London home. Baxter systematically humiliates Henry's grown daughter, an aspiring poet, forcing her to strip off all her clothing in front of her horrified parents, brother, and grandfather. But the young woman's just-published first book of poems, lying on the coffee table, catches Baxter's eye, and he commands her to read from it. She opens the book but recites \"Dover Beach\" from memory instead -- with startling consequences. The transformation of the gangster is abrupt and total. In a flash he goes \"from lord of terror to amazed admirer,\" a state in which it becomes possible for the family to overpower him. Thus does poetry, in effect, disarm the brute and lead to the family's salvation.</p>\n<p>With the restoration of safety and order, McEwan allows himself a little joke at the expense of both Matthew Arnold and his own protagonist. The surgeon tells his daughter of her choice of poem, \"I didn't think it was one of your best.\" The joke, a good one, reminds us of the poem's complicated cultural status: revered, iconic, but also mildly desecrated, like a public statue exposed to pigeons and graffiti artists. But McEwan has already made his more significant point. Just as the instructor in John Brehm's poem can find himself yearning for an escape to an allegorical Sea of Faith, so I believe we all secretly think of poetry, this art that we love unreasonably, as somehow antidotal to malice and vice, cruelty and wrath. We know it isn't so, and yet we persist in writing poems that shoulder the burden of conscience. In <i>The Best American Poetry 2007</i> you will find poems in a variety of tonal registers -- by such poets as Denise Duhamel, Robert Hass, Frederick Seidel, Brian Turner, and Joe Wenderoth -- that address subjects ranging from \"Bush's War\" to the \"language police,\" from the decapitation of an American citizen in Iraq to the overthrow of the shah of Iran.</p>\n<p>For such a poem to gain entry into this volume, it had to meet exceptionally high criteria. Heather McHugh, the editor of <i>The Best American Poetry 2007,</i> sets store, she told an interviewer, by wordplay, puns, rhymes, the hidden life of words, \"the is in the wish, the or in the word. No word-fun should be left undone.\" McHugh has spoken with cutting eloquence against glib and simplistic poems by well-meaning citizens: \"So much contemporary American poetry is deadly serious, reeking of the NPR virtues: back-to-the-earth soup eaten fresh from the woodstove, all its spices listed, then some admirable thoughts to put to paper when we get home. Hey, Romanticism isn't dead -- it's simply being turned to public pap. Against that tedium, a little unholiness comes as a big relief -- the skeptic skeleton, the romping rump.\" But it should also be noted that McHugh herself, for all the wit and wordplay in her poems, has written a poem that I would not hesitate to characterize as powerful, earnest, and political: \"What He Said\" (1994), which culminates in a definition of poetry as what the heretical philosopher Giordano Bruno, when burned at the stake, \"thought, but did not say,\" with an iron mask placed on his face, as the flames consumed him.</p>\n<p>In his poem \"My Heart,\" Frank O'Hara wrote, \"I'm not going to cry all the time / nor shall I laugh all the time, / I don't prefer one 'strain' to another.\" By temperament and inclination I favor both kinds of poems -- the kind that celebrates and the kind that criticizes; the kind that affirms a vow and the kind that makes merry; the poem of high seriousness that would save the world and the poem of high hilarity that would mock the pretensions of saviors. I believe, with Wordsworth, that the poet's first obligation is always to give pleasure, and I would argue, too, that a poem exhibiting the comic spirit can be every bit as serious as a poem devoid of laughter. The poems McHugh gathers in this volume are unafraid to confront the world in its contradictory guises and moods. The unlikely cast of characters includes authentic geniuses from far-flung places: Catullus, Leonardo, Voltaire, Kant, the lyricist Lorenz Hart. There are sonnets and prose poems, a set of haiku and a country-western song, a double abecedarian and a lover's quarrel with a famous Frost poem. And there are poems that take a mischievous delight in the English language as an organic thing, a living system, full of puns that reveal truths just as jokes and errors served Freud: as ways the mind inadvertently discloses itself. Some of these poems are very funny, and need no further justification. \"The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter,\" Mark Twain remarked.</p>\n<p>There is a dangerous if common misconception that a political poem, or <i>any</i> poem that aspires to move the hearts and minds of men and women, must be reducible to a paraphrase the length of a slogan, be it that \"war is hell\" or that \"hypocrisy is rampant\" or that \"it is folly to launch a major invasion without a postwar strategy in place.\" For such sentiments, an editorial or a letter to the editor would serve as the proper vehicle. We want something more complicated and more lasting from poetry. An anecdote from the biography of Oscar Hammerstein II, who succeeded Lorenz Hart as Richard Rodgers's lyricist, may help here. When Stephen Sondheim, then in high school, appealed for advice to Hammerstein, his mentor, the latter criticized a song the young man had written: \"This doesn't say anything.\" Sondheim recalls answering defensively, \"What does 'Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' ' say?\" With a firmness Sondheim would not forget, Hammerstein responded, \"Oh, it says a lot.\"</p>\n<p>The parodist in each of us will continue to enjoy a secret laugh at \"Dover Beach.\" But we also know that people who live in newspapers die for want of what there is in Arnold's poem and in great poetry in general. Real poetry sustains us. György Faludy, the Hungarian poet and Resistance hero, died on September 1, 2006, sixty-seven years to the day after the Nazis invaded Poland. Faludy attacked Hitler in a poem but managed to escape to the United States and served in the American army during World War II. He wasn't nearly so fortunate when he returned to Hungary following the war. For three years, from 1950 to 1953, the Soviets imprisoned Faludy in Recsk, Hungary's Stalinist concentration camp. He endured terrible hardships, but even without a pen he wrote, using the bristle of a broom to inscribe his verses in blood on toilet paper. He had to write. Poetry was keeping him alive. He recited his poems and made fellow prisoners memorize them. The imagination created hope, and the heart committed its lines to memory. When Faludy called his prose book about the years in the camp \"My Happy Days in Hell,\" it was with obvious irony, but it also hinted at his faith. He had listened to the melancholy, long withdrawing roar of the sea, survived the shock, and outlived the Soviet occupation just as his beloved Danube River had done.</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2007 by David Lehman</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>Billy Collins, one of our most beloved poets, has chosen poems of wit, humor, imagination, and surprise, in a range of styles and forms, for <i>The Best American Poetry 2006</i>. The result is a celebration of the pleasures of poetry. <P>In his charming and candid introduction Collins explains how he chose seventy-five poems from among the thousands he considered. With insightful comments from the poets illuminating their work, and series editor David Lehman's thought-provoking foreword, <i>The Best American Poetry 2006</i> is a brilliant addition to a series that links the most noteworthy verse and prose poems of our time to a readership as discerning as it is devoted to the art of poetry.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In the 19th installment of this annual series, former poet laureate Collins (The Trouble with Poetry, 2005), one of America's most popular poets ever, has culled the typical handful of big names and some surprising new voices from more than 50 American literary publications. Collins's predilections for accessibility, humor and tidy forms are evident, but there are also surprises. Usual suspects former Best American editors Ashbery (who surprises with a poem in neatly rhymed couplets), Hass, Simic, Tate and Muldoon, as well as Mary Oliver meet rising masters like Kay Ryan (\"A bird's/ worth of weight/ or one bird-weight/ of Wordsworth\"), Vijay Seshadri and Franz Wright. Most interesting, however, is the chance each volume offers to see which up-and-comers make the cut. This year's roster includes edgy poems by Joy Katz, Danielle Pafunda (\"my hair cramped with sexy\"), Terrance Hayes, and Christian Hawkey (\"O my/ beloved shovel-nosed mole\"), among others. Collins's surprising and opinionated introduction in which he admits that, unlike some of series editor David Lehman's previous guest editors, \"the designation `best' doesn't bother me,\" and offers his definition of a good poem (often one that \"starts in the factual\" and displays \"a tone of playful irreverence\") may cause some controversy.

From the anti-advertising message of <i>Johnny Get Your Money&rsquo;s Worth (and Jane Too)!</i> (1938) to the entertaining lessons in ecology provided by <i>The Day They Parachuted Cats on Borneo</i> (1971), and Sandburg&rsquo;s mockery of war in <i>Rootabaga Pigeons</i> (1923), these pieces will thrill readersintrigued by politics and history &#151; and anyone with a love of children's literature, no matter what age.<p></p>",

I believe lovers of social/political history and inquiring minds in general, [sic] would find this collection appealing.\"-Style Substance Soul,</p>\n<p>One of the \"Best in Paperbacks.\"-Times Herald-Record Sunday,</p>\n<p>\"Julia Mickenburg and Philip Nel have edited a collection of children's literature that represents the left-wing-oriented, oppositional tradition in children's literature in the United States. And a lovely collection it is!... Mickenburg and Nel have done all of us —parents, activists, writers—a service by providing examples of what has been done. The task remains to carry this forward.\"-Science &amp; Society,</p>\n<p>“Mickenberg and Nel have switched on the power of radical children’s literature to maximum wattage, revealing a rich, compelling tradition that deserves our attention. Creating an archive that will have authority and endurance, they have recovered stories encouraging children to engage with social, economic, and environment challenges and to become agents of change.”<br>\n-Maria Tatar,Harvard University, and author of <i>The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen</i></p>\n\n\n</article>"

Are the very words \"prose poem\" an oxymoron? This groundbreaking anthology edited by celebrated poet David Lehman, editor of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> series, traces the form in all its dazzling variety from Poe and Emerson to Auden and Ashbery and on, right up to the present. In his brilliant and lucid introduction, Lehman defines the prose poem, summarizes its French heritage, and outlines its history in the United States. Included here are important works from masters of American literature, as well as poems by contemporary mainstays and emerging talents who demonstrate why the form has become an irresistible option for the practicing poet today. <i>Great American Prose Poems</i> is a marvelous collection, a must-have for anyone interested in the current state of the art.</p>",

    "overview": "<i>The Literature of California</i> is a landmark publication--unmatched by any existing collection and distinguished by its breadth, variety of sources, and historical sweep. The editors have been refreshingly inclusive and imaginative in their selection: some of the writers are internationally known, others are anthologized here for the first time. The richness of material, ranging from Native American origin myths to Hollywood novels dissecting the American Dream; from the familiar voices of John Steinbeck, Jack London, and William Saroyan to the less-well-known narratives of Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, Josephine Miles, and Jade Snow Wong--all of it captures the spirit and scope of the state itself.<br>\nThis first volume of the comprehensive two-volume anthology is divided into four parts. The first includes stories, legends, and songs of the indigenous tribes. The second section comprises letters, diaries, reports, and travel narratives that trace a century of exploration, discovery, and conquest. Part III includes Mother Lode tales by Mark Twain and Bret Harte, the first signs of California poetry, the rise of narrative by California women, the nature writing of John Muir and Mary Austin, and some of the earliest prose from writers of Asian background, as well as the maturing fiction of Jack London and Frank Norris. Part IV traces the period between the World Wars, when California literature came fully into its own.<br>\nA lively introduction contextualizes each section, and concise biographical material is included for each writer. Volume Two, to be published in 2007, concentrates on the second half of the twentieth-century, during which California became one of the most active literary regions in the world. A colossal contribution to the culture of the state, <i>The Literature of California</i> broadens our sense of this region's richness, both past and present, offering new ways of perceiving history, community, and oneself.",

    "synopsis": "<p><P>\"An utterly extraordinary collection, and I have nothing but admiration and highest praise for the selection of the material, its depth and arrangement. It is comprehensive, lively, done with great zest, imagination, and a sense of responsibility toward the state and its literary heritage.\"&#151;Malcolm Margolin, publisher of Heyday Books <P>\"This first volume is a big, generous, and inclusive collection that shows me a host of things that I hadn't read before.\"&#151;Thom Gunn <P>\"This long-awaited volume captures the vast panorama of thought, emotion, and eloquent musings inspired by the landscapes and crossroads culture of the Golden State. The energy and promise and adrenaline of the California dream are richly sampled here, along with its paradoxes and tragic shortcomings. This is a knock-out anthology&#58; indispensable for anyone who cares about American literature and the place of California in the national imagination.\" &#151;Michael Kowalewski, editor, <i>Gold Rush&#58; A Literary Exploration,</i> and former president of the Western Literature Association <P>\"This marvelous collection of literature creates a sense of time and place like no other in the world. California starts in native origin stories; the songs of many cultures and mighty landscapes rightly open this literary treasury. The literature of exploration, conquest, and separation is followed by the rise of romance, irony, adventure and, in the last section, a return to the stories of cultural diversity. Earthmaker, in the opening Maidu creation myth, said 'there will always be songs, and all of you will have them.' That sentiment has endured in <i>The Literature of California.\"</i> &#151;Gerald Vizenor, University of California, Berkeley <P>\"This first volume of <i>The Literature of California</i> is a brilliant and almost impossible achievement. For the first time, the amazing richness of California's literary heritage, from the intricate and beautiful stories of the first Natives to the hard-boiled fiction of Los Angeles, is illuminated here amply and unmistakably and, above all, respectfully. I am awed by these four editors' stunning labor, love for place and word, and finally, profound knowledge of their home region. Superlatives come quickly to mind&#151;extraordinary, monumental, invaluable. I can't wait for volume two.\" &#151;Louis Owens, University of New Mexico <P>\"This anthology comes in the nick of time to re-open our minds to the radically enthusiastic, naively critical, poems, stories and tales that are giving shape to one of the most exciting new cultures on the globe. Volume One curves from the Maidu story that tells of 'Turtle Island' through Clarence King's ringing hammer and Muir's mountain devotionalism, through Jeffers' astute and cranky foresight. We get Dame Shirley's gold country letters and then the freshly appreciated Jaime de Angulo; Josephine Miles together with James F. Cain and Nathanael West! Ending this volume with the tough, acerbic prose of Chester Hymes. Finally- a book to match the land.\" &#151;Gary Snyder<P>\"The publication of this anthology&#151;so comprehensive, so vital in its content, so illustrative of high literary experience&#151;is in and of itself an important milestone in the evolution of California as a foundational component of American civilization. <i>The Literature of California</i> is more than an anthology. It suggests as well a vast public work, a Golden Gate Bridge of intellectual and imaginative materials. Here in this anthology, to paraphrase Joan Didion on UC Berkeley, can now be found one of California's best ideas on itself.\" &#151;Dr. Kevin Starr, State Librarian of California <P>\"An extraordinary volume, at once imaginative, academically sound and meticulously comprehensive.\"&#151;Carolyn See, author of <i>Golden Days</i></p><h3>San Diego Union-Tribune</h3><p>Treats us to a comprehensive look at that body of writing inspired by the Golden Land.</p>",

Whether it was Native Americans living on its land, gold diggers panning its waters, or technology gurus developing Silicon Valley, California has always opened its doors to disconnected people seeking refuge, power, spirituality, fame, or prosperity. The Literature of California, Vol. 1 offers a thorough, chronological review of the writings that flowed from these people. The volume begins with the Native American tales which initiated the spiritual quest that, to this day, continues to draw new residents to the West Coast. Part 2 contains letters, diaries, reports, and travel narratives from Clarence King, Dame Shirley, Sarah Eleanor Royce, and John Rollin Ridge, the first Native American to publish a novel. Part 3 features the stories of popular writers like Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Jack London, and Frank Norris. Part 4, which covers what the editors call \"the period between the world wars,\" includes Robinson Jeffers, Dashiell Hammett, and Nathanael West. It is in these last two sections that the influence of Asian writers begins to take shape. Overall, the diversity and the inclusion of many female authors make this work refreshing. Readers will also come away with a respect for the spirituality embraced by so many of the travelers. A second volume is due in 2002. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>"

Here are classic accounts of iconic American foods: Thoreau on the delights of watermelon; Melville, with a mouth-watering chapter on clam chowder; Mencken on the hot dog; M.F.K.

    "overview": "<p>Fiction. William Saroyan's gift to literature was his humanity. In his five decades of writing short stories, novels, and plays, he saw exuberance where others found sorrow, and he lived a life that was richer and stranger than his fiction. From his humble roots as a bike messenger in Fresno, California, Saroyan went on to enchant the world with his intelligence, insight, and integrity. In drama, short stories, novels, and autobiography, Saroyan explored the universal themes of human existence through a lens that was at once American, Armenian, and global in its outlook. ESSENTIAL SAROYAN brings together acclaimed stories as well as a few surprises from one of California's finest gifts to world literature.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>His name was on the lips of two generations, and people around the world clamored for his work. An Armenian who grew up in Fersno, California, he traveled the globe, living in Paris, London, New York, and Los Angeles. He rubbed elbows with Steinbeck, traded insults with Hemingway, encouraged a young Toshio Mori, and stole a girl from Orson Welles. He was the only writer to turn down the Pulitzer Prize. Through his plays, short stories, and novels, he exalted the mysteries of youth, pondered the impossibility of love, and spoke to this strange condition of being alive. Above all, he declared that the duty of a writer is to have one hell of a good time.</p>",
